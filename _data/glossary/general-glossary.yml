- word_or_term: "Agile \n(Kakama)"
  short_definition: Agile is a method of project management, used especially for software
    development (but is now being used more widely than just development), that is
    characterised by the division of tasks into short phases of work and frequent
    reassessment and adaptation of plans.
  long_definition: 'Agile was originally an approach for software development (but
    is now being adopted more widely in different industries). The agile method gives
    teams the ability to take requirements and allows for their solutions evolve through
    the collaborative effort of self-organising and cross-functional teams and their
    customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development,
    early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible
    response to change. It focuses the team on ''just enough'' (or minimal viable
    product) and those pieces of work should be able to be completed within a one
    to two week planning cycle.


    With the focus not being purely on software development the original Manifesto
    for Agile Software Development has evolved to Modern Agile (see links following),
    which makes agile as a method accessible to other industries.The values and principles
    have been derived from and underpin a broad range of frameworks, including Scrum
    and Kanban.'

    \  In this way, APIs provide a description of how to use the functionality of\

    \ interact with one another through the application programming interface.\n\n\

- word_or_term: Encryption
  short_definition: Converting data from a readable form to an encoded version that
    can only be decoded by another party if they have access to a decryption key.
    Encryption is used to help keep data private, both when it is  transmitted across
    networks, and when it is stored.
  long_definition: "There are two common categories of encryption:\n\n1) Aymmetric-key\
    \ ciphers, also referred to as \"secret key,\" use a single key, sometimes referred\
    \ to as a shared secret because the system doing the encryption must share it\
    \ with any entity it intends to be able to decrypt the encrypted data. The most\
    \ widely used symmetric-key cipher is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES),\
    \ which was designed to protect government classified information. The challenge\
    \ with this form of encryption is that the sender must exchange the key used to\
    \ encrypt the data with the recipient before the recipient can perform decryption\
    \ on the ciphertext. The need to securely distribute and manage large numbers\
    \ of keys means most cryptographic processes use a symmetric algorithm to efficiently\
    \ encrypt data, but they use an asymmetric algorithm to securely exchange the\
    \ secret key.\n\n2) Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography,\
    \ uses two different but mathematically linked keys, one public and one private.\
    \ The public key can be shared with everyone (and is used to encrypt data), whereas\
    \ the private key must be kept secret (as it is used to decrypt data which has\
    \ been encrypted with the private key). The RSA encryption algorithm is the most\
    \ widely used public key algorithm (the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) used by web\
    \ browsers using the HTTPS protocol). \nThis form of cryptography can also be\
    \ used to ensure the integrity (was the data altered since being encrypted), authenticity\
    \ (are you sure it came from the source you think it did) of data through the\
    \ use of digital signatures."

  short_definition: A large feature written as a user story that needs to be broken

    as defined within a single sprint or is large enough that it can be split into
    smaller user stories. It can also be represented by a short phrase instead of
    a user story depending on what it is.


    Epics give you the ability to track large, loosely defined ideas in the backlog
    without the need to overpopulate your backlog with multiple items, if the idea
    isn''t fully formed yet. At the point that it''s more formed you are able to break
    the epic down into smaller user stories and track against the delivery of the

- word_or_term: Hypothesis - Null Hypothesis
  short_definition: 'A null hypothesis is the proposition that there is no cause and
    effect relationship between phenomena or populations. '
  long_definition: 'Using a null hypothesis is useful because it can be tested and
    found to be false, which then implies that there is a relationship between the
    observed data.


    It is much easier to disprove a hypothesis than to positively prove one.


    A common approach is to reject a null hypothesis if the observed data are significantly
    unlikely (stats definition) to have occurred if the null hypothesis were true.'
  example: '"Hyperactivity is unrelated to eating sugar" is an example of a null hypothesis.
    If the hypothesis is tested and found to be false, using statistics, then a connection
    between hyperactivity and sugar ingestion may be indicated. A significance test
    is the most common statistical test used to establish confidence in a null hypothesis."


    "You may be wondering why you would want to test a hypothesis just to find it
    false. Why not just test an alternate hypothesis and find it true? The short answer
    is that it is part of the scientific method. In science, propositions are not
    explicitly "proven." Rather, science uses math to determine the probability that
    a statement is true or false. It turns out it''s much easier to disprove a hypothesis
    than to positively prove one. Also, while the null hypothesis may be simply stated,
    there''s a good chance the alternate hypothesis is incorrect."'

    The retrospective is facilitated generally by the scrum master. There are several
    different approaches for running a retrospective and these sessions can also be
    tailored to themes that may have come up throughout the sprint. The retrospective

    teams to work through complex adaptive problems, by breaking them down into small
    features that are be delivered in small managable pieces in short timeframes or
    sprint''s. This approach allows for fast feedback, and the opportunity to review
    as a team how they work together and identify areas they need to improve. By the
    end of the sprint the team should be delivering features or products of the highest
    value and features or products that do ''just enough'' to get the job done.


    the scrum team self organises on a daily basis with a stand-up, there are
    regular backlog refinement sessions, sprint planning, retrospectives to
    allow for transparency and support to remove anything stopping them from completing
    a feature or story.
