- word_or_term: LOA (Level of Assurance) - Authentication
  short_definition: The strength of the authentication method(s) used in a particular
    authentication instance
  long_definition: "The strength of the authentication method(s) used in a particular\
    \ authentication instance. An LOA framework allows an identity provider to indicate\
    \ to a service provider (relying party) how much trust is behind the authentication\
    \ event. The relying party determines what levels they require to allow access\
    \ to their service. The following is a summary of the four levels:\n Level 1:\
    \ Allows wide range of authentication technologies. Requires the user to prove\
    \ through a secure authentication protocol that he/she controls the token (password).\
    \ Does not require use of cryptographic methods. All authentication methods accepted\
    \ for other levels satisfy Level 1.\n Level 2: Provides single factor network\
    \ authentication. A wide range of authentication technologies can be employed.\
    \ It allows any of the token methods of Levels 3 or 4, as well as passwords and\
    \ PINs. Successful authentication requires that the claimant prove through a secure\
    \ authentication protocol that he or she controls the token. Passwords must be\
    \ strong.\n Level 3: Based on proof of possession of a cryptographic key using\
    \ a cryptographic protocol. Three kinds of tokens may be used to meet Level 3\
    \ requirements: \u201Csoft\u201D cryptographic token, \u201Chard\u201D token,\
    \ or \u201Cone-time password\u201D device token. Requires two factor authentication;\
    \ in addition to the key, the user must employ a password or biometric to activate\
    \ the key.\n Level 4: Intended to provide the highest practical remote network\
    \ authentication assurance, and is based on proof of possession of a key through\
    \ a cryptographic protocol. Similar to Level 3 except only \u2018hard\u2019 cryptographic\
    \ tokens are allowed.\n See \u2018Authentication Standards\u2019 and \u2018Evidence\
