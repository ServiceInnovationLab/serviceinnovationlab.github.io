data:
- word_or_term: NEET
  short_definition: Acronym - Not in Education, Employment or Training
  long_definition: This acronym is used to describe usually under 25s, rather than
    older people. It is usually desirable for a young person to be in education, employment,
    or training, so this is seen as a negative thing.
  example: "\"The seasonally adjusted rate of young people aged 15\u201324 years who\
    \ were not in employment, education, or training (NEET) rose to 12.4 percent in\
    \ the March 2018 quarter, up from 11.8 percent in the December 2017 quarter. The\
    \ NEET rate was 12.7 percent a year ago.\""
