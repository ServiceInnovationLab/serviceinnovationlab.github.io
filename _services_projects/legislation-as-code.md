### Citizenship by Grant

A complex formula from within the Citizenship Act, used to calculate if an applicant has been in the country enough days to satisfy a clause. This was encoded into a rules engine called OpenFisca, along with some related sections of Immigration Act.

### Accident Compensation

With ACC and MBIE we explored the entitlement clauses in the Accident Compensation Act to see where descretion is applied, then looked to see how these could be encoded. The sections related to Loss of Potential Earnings, and Rehabilitation were encoded into Open Fisca.
