## Overview

Emerging technologies are set to disrupt a number of government processes and services, alongside citizens engagement with government and the services they offer. The EmTech 20-year landscape is a piece of ongoing research, that’s intended to help people working in government understand the types, forms, connections and impacts of these different technologies and the challenges and opportunities posed by developments in the EmTech space. The outcome of having this consistently evolving landscape is that people working in these spaces can better understand how emerging technologies are relevant to their work, and use this to inform their decisions.

The diagram displays a time scale of “Current”, “0 to 5 years”, “5 to 10 years” and “10 to 20 years” on the vertical axis and 13 categories of emerging technology along the horizontal access. The 13 categories of emerging technology are: cloud computing, big data/analytics, encryption/privacy, internet of things, spatial computing, artificial intelligence tools, artificial intelligence applications, robotics/production, autonomous agents, symbiotic application, bio-tech and quantum computing. Categories are laid out from left to right, with cloud computing being furthest left, and quantum computing being furthest right. The cards underneath each category display the specific technology which falls under the category listed in one of the 13 columns.

It is worth noting that this landscape projects details up to the use and release of Quantum Computing as the possibilities of the technology being ubiquitously used, will more than likely change the entire landscape.

### How the Landscape was constructed

The selected technologies and their positioning on the landscape has been informed by research and shaped by consultation with other emerging tech leaders engaged through participation in forums.  The landscape was constructed by applying a governmental lens which enables a better digital public service.
These sources include:

- [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/sti/emerging-tech/)
- [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/07/these-are-the-top-10-emerging-technologies-of-2019/)
- [McKinsey Institute](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/disruptive-technologies)
- [Gartner - Hype Cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3887767)
- [SAP](https://www.sap.com/australia/trends.html)
- [AIForum New Zealand](https://aiforum.org.nz/)

### Technology to focus on

With such a vast array of technology in the landscape the lab has seven key areas of technology that should have a high priority focus.

- Artificial Intelligence
- Spatial Computing
- Encryption
- Internet of Things
- Big Data
- Robotics and Autonomous Systems
- Quantum Computing

## Opportunities for Further Work

This is a piece of work that has the potential to expand and develop.
Possible future work could be:

**Application of different lenses**<br/>
Applying different lenses onto this landscape will most likely see the landscape change. An example of another lens would be that of digital inclusion, which would identify technology that could ensure a more equitable digital environment for all.

**Workshops with external partners**<br/>
To help broaden the technologies represented in the landscape engaging with both other government agencies and various private sector organisations would she light into what developing trends there are within New Zealand.

**Landscape visualisation development**<br/>
The landscape can be developed to be more interactive and more interconnected. Development of interactive cards of the landscape which display definitions of the technology could be developed.
Furthermore development of visualisation connections to show dependencies of technology to other technology could be introduced.

**Primer per category**<br/>
A primer template has been created and an example AI Primer can be found in the resources. A primer can be utilised to further explain the categories at the top of the landscape in relation to what it is, examples of it and other details listed in the template.

**Disruption**<br/>
Work into understanding how disruptive the technology listed in the landscape is to the current environment should be investigated. This should be visualised on the landscape itself, and integrating disruption into the Primer.

### Detailed description of the 20 Year Emerging Technology Landscape

#### Overview

The main table displays the 20-year emerging technology landscape.
There are 4 rows representing periods of time, from top to bottom:

- Current
- 0 to 5 years from now
- 5 to 10 years from now
- 10 to 20 years from now

Each row illustrates how far in the future the technology is expected to become commonly used.
There are 13 columns labelled with categories of emergent technology, from left to right:

- Cloud Computing
- Big Data/Analytics
- Encryption/Privacy
- Internet of Things
- Spatial Computing
- Artificial Intelligence Tools
- Artificial Intelligence Applications
- Robotics, Production
- Autonomous Agents
- Symbiotic Application
- Bio-Tech
- Quantum Computing

Columns for technology categories which are in common use now are on the left.
As you read each column from left to right, the technology categories are increasingly experimental, still in research and development, or limited to academic of private institutions.
53 technologies are represented in the diagram, each one placed in its respective column (for its category) and row (for when it will be in use, for example in 10 to 20 years).
