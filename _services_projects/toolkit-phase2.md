# Toolkit project - About this project

The toolkit is for people and organisations involved or interested in public sector innovation. Its for people who are interested in connecting with us as the lab, to contribute and learn.

The Toolkit is an online showcase, that is an authoritative reflection of who we are, what we do and how we do it. 

Unlike other sources of information (Non authoritative or independent sources of truth), like [digital.govt.nz](https://digital.govt.nz), our Toolkit will be readily consumable and represent us in our language.

Please be aware that the site is a first iteration and will be a work in progress so content will change over time when people add their content. The goal is to develop our instructions to support our people in our team who wish to add and approve content to the toolkit. Itâ€™s about empowering our people to be comfortable with tech and publishing regularly the work that we do. 

The site runs off github and this is where we add and approve content before it is published to the live site.
