title: Becoming an Adult
subtitle: While the focus was on shaping government services around entry to adulthood (see the reports at left), this was also the first chance for the whole design team to work together to achieve the brief faster and to consolidate our approach on how we run research discoveries. Part of this was to test our new measurement framework to better understand what good work looks like at a project level. For more detail read What Does ‘Good’ Look Like? Innovation in Public Service Design.

excerpt: Every teen’s experience of entering adulthood will differ and there are many reasons why. This project focused on improving how young adults access government services and how they manage their identity to do this.
