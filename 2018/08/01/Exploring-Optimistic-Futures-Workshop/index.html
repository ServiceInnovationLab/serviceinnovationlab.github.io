<p>The following is content generated in the Transitioning to an Optimistic Future event held as part of Tech Week 2018. Duration 3 hours.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The event was designed to build on the concepts and discussions had as part of the Digital Seven Nations and Optimistic Futures Event. In particular we wanted to focus on the human aspect of transition and what would be required of New Zealanders in the future. The topics of discussion were chosen as they we all universally understood human features and common daily activities. This created a level foundation to debate from as opposed to getting caught up in complex technologies and paradigms that could distract and exclude. The role of technology was tightly framed as an enabler and second to behaviour, attributes and activity.</p>

<p>Event Description:</p>

<p>Building on the <a href="https://www.optimisticfutures.nz/">Optimistic Futures</a> event held earlier in the year, in this workshop we will explore what’s required for New Zealand/Aotearoa to transition to a better future, moving from an 18th century to a 21st century society.</p>

<p>This includes considering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the role of government</li>
  <li>the role of technology</li>
  <li>what foundations are needed to support society</li>
  <li>what role everyone would play in an optimistic future</li>
</ul>

<p>Brought to you by <a href="https://www.victoria.ac.nz/">Victoria University of Wellington</a>, <a href="https://internetnz.nz/">InternetNZ</a> and the <a href="http://serviceinnovationtoolkit.wikidot.com/main:about">Service Innovation Lab</a>.</p>

<p>This event is part of the Techweek series on Building Government’s Digital Service Innovation Capability. The room was divided into 4 large groups for discussion and exploration.</p>

<h2 id="group-share-and-reflection">Group share and reflection</h2>

<p>At the end of the day there was a group share and reflection which had the following insights.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The initial discussion was not about the tech, it was about the people</li>
  <li>Of interest – dealing with someone’s intellect after death…and how this could benefit society</li>
  <li>Huge number of changes noticed with the activity – progressing from person’s exercise to societal benefits</li>
  <li>How will government incentivise the changes we’ve identified (that need to happen for optimistic future)?
** More intuitive change, tapping into the psyche of the people</li>
  <li>Noted we will share outputs from session plus what is happening at MBIE (digital strategy “speed dating” sessions)</li>
  <li>Starting off with the values was the right type of exercise J
** Had people think about what we’re trying to achieve/the end goal in mind</li>
  <li>Next conversations we need to have:
** Some kind of personal commitment – make it concrete
** Co-build a public facing repository of the information</li>
  <li>What caused most discussion:
** The ethical considerations + having a broader community discussion (beyond government)
** Where will the conversation take place + how do we bring other voices in?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="activity-one---qualities-to-thrive-as-kiwis-in-2070">Activity One - Qualities to thrive as kiwis in 2070</h2>

<p><strong>Participants were asked to then reflect on the previous activities and discuss and answer the following questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>What effects could this have at a community or national level e.g. benefits and challenges?</li>
  <li>Should government play a role? if so what?</li>
  <li>How could technology enable these?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="group-1---have-a-funeral">Group 1 - have a funeral</h3>

<ol>
  <li>National and Community level:
    <ul>
      <li>Pragmatics sorted control</li>
      <li>Will of how your ‘mind’ can be used after your death</li>
      <li>How can you participate in society after you die?  E.g. can you vote, give testimony etc.</li>
      <li>What are your rights</li>
      <li>How does this effect whakapapa? Does your mind get passed down - whole new oral tradition</li>
      <li>Can virtual minds aggregate knowledge/take action? E.g. indigenous minds protect against colonialism</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Role of Government:
    <ul>
      <li>Does government ‘own’ its citizens minds after death?</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How can technology enable:
    <ul>
      <li>Safeguards - controlling/choosing how your mind can be used/altered - git control not blockchain</li>
