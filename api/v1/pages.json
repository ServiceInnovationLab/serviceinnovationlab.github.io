One of these, Result 10, aimed to improve interaction with government. Research uncovered many pain points for people when accessing government services, especially where they needed to interact with multiple government agencies. For example: when applying for financial support related to a significant life event such as having a baby. Poorly integrated digital services were pushing customers back to non-digital channels and this became the driver of our approach and work. In 2013 the Digital Service Council (DSC), comprising eight agencies, was established to provide governance to this programme. In 2014 priority was given to integrated services associated with life events. DSC also agreed for agencies to develop a federated model of service delivery to reduce customer effort and deliver efficiencies for agencies. November 2015 a Service Innovation Reference Group (SIRG) was established to provide support to SIWG by detailing of the work programme and initiatives. Hosting a cross-agency workshop at the lab’s offices February 2017, the Service Innovation Lab (the Lab) was founded with support from the Service Innovation Work Programme Team from Internal Affairs, Assurity Consulting Ltd and direction from the SIRG. Secretariat and management overview is provided by Internal Affairs, which is the Government’s functional lead agency for digital development. …and this is where the Service Innovation Lab’s story starts and is detailed across this site."},{"title":"About the Service Innovation Lab","url":"/about/purpose/","tags":[],"body":"Purpose We were setup to: Grow the ecosystem of services built with government components Reduce barriers to building better digital services Accelerate development of life event services Change perceptions of government being slow and behind with technology Enable a culture of experimentation and adaptiveness Provide a neutral place not linked to a specific agency, product or service in order to provide an outside-in ‘joined up’ view of government services."},{"title":"About the Service Innovation Lab","url":"/about/work-programme/","tags":[],"body":"Work Programme Our work programme included initiatives that usually fall outside the remit, capability or budget of a single agency. All the initiatives we worked on are service delivery focused. They either helped people interact with government directly or indirectly by improving the behind the scenes processes and infrastructure to enable a better experience for those who deliver them and receive them. This indirect work is part of our goal of opening up government services and data so it can be reused safely by other parts of local and central government but private sector and NGO service providers. We call this Government as a Platform. Basically it’s about ensuring people’s government experiences are easy, equitable and empathetic.

This will remain true until the robotic apocalypse finally occurs. Humans learn. Humans make mistakes. This peer-review based workflow is used by our team to foster a welcoming environment where we all are lifelong learners, and we support each other as a team to do the best we can, which includes not making mistakes. Peer review We do not work alone. All work has at least two developers involved in any changes. Pull Requests Any dev can propose a code change (a PR). Propose the PR on GitHub, as a proposed change to the dev branch. See “Branch Naming” later in this document. A PR description must include what has changed, but also why it needs to change. (a business or user need). One other dev must approve the PR before it can be merged. Approving a PR means you agree the code works as described and meets our quality levels. For most PRs this will require running the code yourself. Mention on the PR if you didn’t. If there is an associated Trello story, or GitHub issue, provide some details and link to it. If there is no associated story, explain why briefly. PR Feedback / Reviews Commenting on a pull request (opens a link to GitHub) As a team, we attempt to give at least one comment/feedback on each PR. This normalises asking questions. It should be unusual for a PR to have zero feedback. Feedback should be something that could be better. “I love this” isn’t enough. Feedback is given in a form of “Have you considered…” or otherwise doesn’t assume the author didn’t already attempt your alternative approach. “Do it this other way” is not feedback. Comments can be “blocking” meaning the author wants a response to their feedback, or they can be a suggestion only, leaving the decision to the PR author. Indicate this using emoji. Elephant :elephant = suggestion only. Adding line comments to a pull request (opens a link to GitHub) As a reviewer, you can approve a PR using the “Approve” option on Github. Request changes to a PR using the “Request changes” option. Quality Code needs to pass code linters (we use codeclimate). Markup generated for webpages must pass accessibility checkers. Merging PR branches need to be “up to date”, and continuous integration via Travis-ci must run and pass before merging. New code must have tests, and minimum code coverage levels need to be met and maintained. Merges into the dev branch need only one approval to merge but give all active team members reasonable chance to review unless the change is trivial. The dev who proposed the PR presses the merge button on a PR once all the above passes & it is approved. That dev is responsible for merging in a way that does not “break the build” or cause unplanned outages. The branch should be deleted automatically (by the always-be-closing bot) after merging. This keeps the repo tidy. Commit Messages Commit messages should describe the reason for the changes being committed, so that anyone viewing the commit can know what has changed and why. Good messages: Updating Travis config to include dependency installation Bad messages: Updating Travis Really bad commit messages: Fixing stuff so it works Please let it work this time Commit Hello Branch Naming Branch naming in a consistent manner is good for keeping things tidy, and add context to any commit messages for commits against the branch. Branch names should be descriptive and their meanings clear. Additionally, branch names can contain / characters, so a good way to keep types of branches separate is to “namespace” them - for example, any branches whose main purpose is to add a new feature to the application should have the prefix “feature”. Branches for fixing bugs should be prefixed with “bugfix”, while a branch for something urgent that is going to go to production asap should be prefixed with “hotfix”. Here are some examples: feature/automated_dishwasher_emptying fix/ui_disabled_for_anon_users hotfix/offline_jobs_errors Continuous Deployment Our code deploys automatically after a git merge into special branches. dev branch deploys to staging. master branch deploys to production."},{"title":"Digital Identity Glossary","url":"/digital-identity-glossary/","tags":[],"body":"General Glossary Techy Terms Glossary Digital Identity Digital Wallet Digital Identity Glossary Word or Term Short Definition Long Definition Example Reference 2FA Two-Factor Authentication (v) (AuthN) See: MFA A method of authentication that requires two different authentication factors; typically something you know (username/password) and something that you have (a token or cell-phone) or something that you are (a biometric).

Biometrics Metrics related to human characteristics Biometrics is the measurement and statistical analysis of people's unique physical and behavioral characteristics. The technology is mainly used for identification and access control, or for identifying individuals who are under surveillance. The basic premise of biometric authentication is that every person can be accurately identified by his or her intrinsic physical or behavioral traits. “Biometrics include fingerprints, face recognition, DNA and iris recognition”. Search Security Blinding Providing a service to a client in an encoded form without knowing either the real input or output A privacy protocol that allows individuals to easily connect to partnering online services using an existing, trusted log in credential, while limiting the actual amount of data being transmitted for security. There can be three levels of blinding. Triple blinding occurs when there are three participants involved in an ecosystem other than the user to prevent knowledge about other parties. “Use of blinding prevents personal information being shared unnecessarily with participants in a digital identity ecosystem”.

Techopedia Digital Identity A digital identity is information on an entity used by computer systems to represent an external agent. That agent may be a person, organization, application, or device. ISO/IEC 24760-1 defines identity as \"set of attributes related to an entity\". A version, or facet, of a person's social identity - see also Persona (often used interchangably in common usage). Digital Identity is an electronic representation of an individual (or entity or device). Digital Identity allows people to undertake online what they have traditionally completed manually. The information contained in a digital identity allows for assessment and authentication of a user interacting with a business system on the web, without the involvement of human operators. Digital identities allow our access to computers and the services they provide to be automated, and make it possible for computers to mediate relationships. The term \"digital identity\" has also come to denote aspects of civil and personal identity that have resulted from the widespread use of identity information to represent people in computer systems. Simple view: “I have many logons, but only one Identity”. \"Digital identity is now often used in ways that require data about persons stored in computer systems to be linked to their civil, or national, identities.\" \"The use of digital identities is now so widespread that many discussions refer to \"digital identity\" as the entire collection of information generated by a person’s online activity. This includes usernames and passwords, online search activities, birth date, social security, and purchasing history. Especially where that information is publicly available and not anonymized, and can be used by others to discover that person's civil identity. In this wider sense, a digital identity is a version, or facet, of a person's social identity. This may also be referred to as an online identity.\" Wikipedia https://www.webstock.org.nz/talks/mend-broken-identity/ Electronic Identity Credential A verified identity that has been issued by an identity service provider An electronic identity credential is a record kept in electronic form by an identity service provider that— a) contains authenticated core identity information about an individual; and b) is assigned a unique code (or identifier) by the Service. The electronic identity credential may contain as much of the following core identity information about an individual as it is possible to authenticate: a) the individual’s full name: b) the individual’s sex: c) the individual’s date of birth: d) the individual’s place of birth. “The RealMe Verified service can assert your Electronic Identity Credential to participating agencies”.

Guide to Authentication Standards Evidence of Identity Confidence Levels Confidence levels corresponding to Identity Service Risk Categories The following outlines the EOI Confidence Levels required for corresponding Service Risk Categories: Nil or Negligible: No specific EOI process required. Low: Agency requires evidence that identity claimed is genuine identity, individual is sole claimant, and identity claimed is used in the community. EOI is accepted at ‘face value’ without third party verification unless discrepancies identified. Moderate: Agency requires evidence that identity claimed is genuine identity, identity is living, the presenting individual links to the identity, individual is sole claimant, and (if required) identity claimed is used in the community. EOI is accepted at ‘face value’ without third party verification unless discrepancies identified. High: Agency requires evidence that identity claimed is genuine identity, identity is living, the presenting individual links to the identity, individual is sole claimant, and identity claimed is used in the community. EOI, where possible, is verified with a third party to confirm its authenticity. See ‘LOA (Level of Assurance) - Authentication’, ‘LOA (Level of (Assurance) - Identity’ and ‘Authentication Standards’. “Applying for a passport requires an EOI Confidence Level of high”. NZ EOI Standards FLT (Real Me) Federated Logon Tag The Federated Logon Tag is a unique, persistent identifier generated by the RealMe Logon Service which is applicable to a single privacy context or domain; typically a government agency. Each FLT is “federated identifier” or “pairwise identifier” in that each one is unique to a particular logon account in a specific privacy context. That is to say, for a given logon account, there is a unique FLT for each agency or relying party. Example: “When I log on with RealMe to different agencies, each agency receives a unique FLT”. Identification The action or process of identifying someone or something or the fact of being identified The process of establishing or verifying information about an individual, entity or device through proving ownership of official documents (eg. drivers licence, passport), consulting alternative data sources to corroborate the identity being claimed, and collecting biometric data from the individual to link them to source records. “The RealMe IVS product provides an identification service” Developing Options for a new Approach to Digital Identity Cabinet Paper - DIA Identity Attribute An attribute, such as name or hair colour that is associated with an identity.

The principles cover: Purpose of collection of personal information Source of personal information Collection of information Manner of collection of personal information Storage and security of personal information Access to personal information Correction of personal information Accuracy of personal information Retention of personal information Limits on use of personal information Limits on disclosure of personal information Unique identifiers. Of these, IPP 6 and IPP 12 are of particularly relevance to digital identity. Privacy Act 1993 IPP 12 The government is not allowed to assign a single identifier to be used across all of government. Information Privacy Principle 12 governs how \"unique identifiers\" - such as IRD numbers, bank client numbers, driver's licence and passport numbers - can be used. A unique identifier cannot be assigned to an individual unless this is necessary for an agency to carry out 1 or more of its functions efficiently, and all reasonable steps must be taken to ensure unique identifiers are assigned only to individuals whose identity is clearly established. A unique identifier can also not be assigned to an individual if it has been assigned to that individual by another agency. Example: “RealMe uses a system of IPP 12 compliant federated identifiers which anonymises information being shared”. Privacy Act 1993, Part 2, Section 6 IPP 6 Information Privacy Principle 6 Information Privacy Principle 6 gives individuals the right to access information about themselves, and be able to request correction of information held by an agency. “I requested information from an agency, citing IPP 6 as their requirement to provide it”. Privacy Act 1993, Part 2, Section 6 LOA (Level of (Assurance) - Identity The strength of the processes used to identify the user at the time of user registration The strength of the processes used to identify the user at the time of user registration. An LOA framework allows an identity provider to indicate to a service provider (relying party) how much trust is behind the authentication event. The relying party determines what levels they require to allow access to their service. The following is a summary of the four levels: Level 1: No proofing requirement at this level. However, fact that user is able to authenticate to identity provider gives some assurance. The identity provider has some relationship with the user because they have issued them a credential (username and password or cryptographic key). Level 2: Identity proofing requirements are introduced, requiring presentation of identifying materials and information. Both in-person and remote registration are permitted. For in-person registration the applicant must be in possession of a primary government photo ID (e.g. driver’s licence or passport). For remote registration, the applicant submits the references of and attests to current possession of at least one primary government photo ID and a second form of identification. The applicant must provide at a minimum their name, date of birth, and current address or personal telephone number. Level 3: Identity proofing procedures require verification of identifying materials and information. Both in-person and remote registration are permitted. Requires the same evidence for issuing credentials as Level 2; however, verification of the documents or references through record checks is required. Level 4: Remote registration is not permitted at this level. The applicant must appear in person. Presentation and verification of two independent ID documents or accounts is required, meeting the requirements of Level 3, one of which must be a current primary government photo ID that contains the applicant’s picture, and either address of record or nationality (e.g. driver’s license or passport). A new recording of a biometric of the applicant at the time of application is also required to ensure the applicant cannot repudiate the application. See ‘Authentication Standards’ and ‘Evidence of Identity Confidence Levels’. \"A RealMe verified identity is established at a Level 4 (high) Level of Assurance”. NIST (SP800-63-2) LOA (Level of Assurance) - Authentication The strength of the authentication method(s) used in a particular authentication instance The strength of the authentication method(s) used in a particular authentication instance. An LOA framework allows an identity provider to indicate to a service provider (relying party) how much trust is behind the authentication event. The relying party determines what levels they require to allow access to their service. The following is a summary of the four levels: Level 1: Allows wide range of authentication technologies. Requires the user to prove through a secure authentication protocol that he/she controls the token (password). Does not require use of cryptographic methods. All authentication methods accepted for other levels satisfy Level 1. Level 2: Provides single factor network authentication. A wide range of authentication technologies can be employed. It allows any of the token methods of Levels 3 or 4, as well as passwords and PINs. Successful authentication requires that the claimant prove through a secure authentication protocol that he or she controls the token. Passwords must be strong. Level 3: Based on proof of possession of a cryptographic key using a cryptographic protocol. Three kinds of tokens may be used to meet Level 3 requirements: “soft” cryptographic token, “hard” token, or “one-time password” device token. Requires two factor authentication; in addition to the key, the user must employ a password or biometric to activate the key. Level 4: Intended to provide the highest practical remote network authentication assurance, and is based on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. Similar to Level 3 except only ‘hard’ cryptographic tokens are allowed. See ‘Authentication Standards’ and ‘Evidence of Identity Confidence Levels’. Example: “RealMe logon requires Level 2 Level of Assurance”. NIST (SP800-63-2) Log on (v), The act of presenting Authentication Credentials. Also Log in, Sign in In computer security, logging on (or logging in or signing) is the process by which an individual gains access to a computer system by identifying and authenticating themselves. The user presents credentials are typically some form of \"username\" and a matching \"password\" and for higher levels of assurance another factor such as a one-time-password or biometric. “In order for me to file taxes online, you must first log on to MyIR”. Logon (n) An account used to access a service. Also Login, Logon Account or Login Account A user account, typically comprised of a user identifier and a password, that an individual uses to authenticate themselves, typically to on online service. A logon can optionally have additional authentication factors (a PIN, one-time-password, SMS message or biometric) for higher levels of assurance. Example: “I have many Logons for business activities and a bunch of other Logons for personal activities”. MFA Multi-Factor Authentication A method of authentication that requires at least two different authentication factors; typically something you know (username/password) and something that you have (a token or cell-phone) or something that you are (a biometric). Moderate strength authentication required. See ‘Authentication Standards’. ”Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is usually required for services in the high risk category”.

Also refers to the User Experience concept of a persona - see General - Persona. “I access the school’s portal in teacher persona during the day and my parent persona in the evening”. \"We work with organizations of all sizes, big and small. I have coached many business leaders and executives on how to build their Twitter persona and how to use Twitter and other social networks for business.\" \"Thanks to the proliferation of these identity providers, we have come to a point that when visitors login to websites, they’re not just choosing to do so with an identity provider – they’re choosing a persona. This is a dramatic shift on the Web when we consider that just a few years ago there were no scaled identity providers. Personas exist naturally because the Web mirrors real life.

Relying Party The entity that consumes authentication, identities or attributes from any type of Identity Provider and trusts that information to make business or service delivery decisions, or enable access to digital services. ”A bank is a relying party for proof of identity information to ensure compliance with AML/CFT regulations”. Risk Based Authentication (RBA) Emerging technology using range of user factors to determine whether this user is potentially dangerous RBA is a form of strong authentication that calculates a risk score for any given access attempt in real time, based on a predefined set of rules. Users are then presented with authentication options appropriate to that risk level. “Risk Based Authentication can reduce an organisation’s exposure to costly, reputation-damaging information security breaches”. http://blog.identityautomation.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication Role Job function or title which bestows specific authorities. An identity attribute that gives users privileges when assigned. Roles often take the form of groups wherein the members of a group have on or more authorities or privileges. “You can only access the HRMS if you have the role of HR Advisor”. Self-Asserted Attribute An attribute, asserted by the subject. An attribute, asserted by the subject without verification by any third party authority. “My cell phone number is a self-asserted attribute”. Service Provider An agency or private sector company that offers services. A government agency, private sector business or individual that provides services of value. The services are typically delivered, requested or otherwise augmented via Internet transactions. Can also be a Relying Party. \"Some service providers require verified identity to enable access to some of their services online”. SSO Single Sign On A property of access control of multiple related, yet independent, software systems, which allows users to log in with a single ID and password to gain access to a connected system or systems without using different usernames or passwords, or in some configurations seamlessly sign on at each system. \"With OneLogin’s single sign-on portal users only have to enter one set of credentials to access to their web apps in the cloud and behind the firewall – via desktops, smartphones and tablets.

Agents may be \"embodied\" (e.g. a robot), or embedded (such as in a chatbot executing on a phone (e.g. Siri)). Software agents may be autonomous or work together with other agents or people. Agents interacting with people may possess human-like qualities such as natural language understanding and speech, personality. - Intelligent agents exhibit some aspect of artificial intelligence, such as learning and reasoning. - Autonomous agents are capable of modifying the way in which they achieve their objectives. - Distributed agents are executed on physically distinct computers - Multi-agent systems are a collection of distributed agents that work together to achieve an objective that could not be accomplished by a single agent acting alone - Mobile agents are agents that can relocate their execution onto different processors Wikipedia Agile (Kakama) Agile is a method of project management, used especially for software development (but is now being used more widely than just development), that is characterised by the division of tasks into short phases of work and frequent reassessment and adaptation of plans. Agile was originally an approach for software development (but is now being adopted more widely in different industries). The agile method gives teams the ability to take requirements and allows for their solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organising and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. It focuses the team on 'just enough' (or minimal viable product) and those pieces of work should be able to be completed within a one to two week planning cycle. With the focus not being purely on software development the original Manifesto for Agile Software Development has evolved to Modern Agile (see links following), which makes agile as a method accessible to other industries.The values and principles have been derived from and underpin a broad range of frameworks, including Scrum and Kanban. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Dictionary http://modernagile.org http://agilemanifesto.org AISA (Approved Information Sharing Agreement) An enabling tool that allows government agencies to provide efficient and effective public services by allowing agencies to collaborate and share information without intruding on individuals' rights or exposing agencies to legal risk. As of 2018 around 7 AISAs exist between government agencies. An AISA exists between Inland Revenue and New Zealand Police \"to assist Police to deliver the public service of reducing the rate of serious criminal offending in New Zealand. This agreement authorises the disclosure of information to New Zealand Police to assist Police to deliver the public service of reducing the rate of serious criminal offending in New Zealand.\" https://www.privacy.org.nz/privacy-for-agencies/information-sharing/approved-information-sharing-agreements/ Alpha (phase of Lab workflow model) The third phase in the Service Innovation Operational Workflow Model where a very basic working service is developed to gather user feedback, test that it works as intended, and inform whether it is technically feasible to build. See also Minimum Viable Product (MVP) As the service is built the team seeks to: 1) Test the hypotheses created in the Design Discovery phase. 2) Test that the service you want to build is technically possible 3) Test that the service facilitates intended outcomes 4) Observe if the service causes any unintended outcomes Research is completed with a small group of users, and early feedback is gathered about the design of the service. Note: Software in Alpha state can start to be tested with users beyond limited levels enabled by rough prototypes. Alpha software must be considered unstable - with implications including data loss. \"If you pass an alpha assessment, you can start writing your code in production and recruiting users to use your private beta.\" (GOV.UK Service Standard) Service Innovation Lab - Welcome Pack https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DQOS4bhd8VcZY2ftpGGN-lco-5jdiI9_z66Yg4Jpu-Y/edit?usp=sharing UK Government Service Assessments https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/how-service-assessments-work API Application Programming Interface A set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. Computer programs are typically organised and assembled into some type of software components that are combined to form larger IT systems. To prevent a massive tangle of complex software in which every piece of software is able to talk to every other piece of software, interfaces (or APIs) are used to partition the IT system. An API hides a lot of detail of the internal workings of a software component that the outside world does not need to know. In this way, APIs provide a description of how to use the functionality of a software component and to exchange data with it. At run-time, software components interact with one another through the application programming interface. Governments are currently thinking about APIs for service delivery, including how open government APIs can be used to deliver innovative services by third parties, and by businesses to directly transact with government. \"There are over a thousand applications which use the Trade Me API, built by individuals or organisations outside Trade Me. These applications provide services which meet needs of users not catered for by the Trade Me website or API - in some cases by providing a different interface to the same underlying functions - and in other cases by mashing up a combination of APIs.\" NZ Companies Office: \"We offer a range of APIs that help our customers to build software that connects directly to our systems.\" \"NZQA has created an API to allow access to a student’s Record of Achievement”.

An intelligent agent is any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. In everyday usage, \"artificial intelligence\" refers to any time when a machine mimics \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\". Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as Chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, and intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations. Machine learning algorithms (software) are a subset of AI algorithms - these are computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience (they are trained to recognise patterns). For any system that learns, the output is determined by the input it receives. There are therefore many sources of bias. These sources include (but are not limited to!) the data we use to train systems, and our interactions with them in the “wild\". \"we often see the machine learning and AI buzzwords being thrown around to indicate that an algorithm was used to analyze data and make a prediction. Using an algorithm to predict an outcome of an event is not machine learning. Using the outcome of your prediction to improve future predictions is.\" Wikipedia https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/artificial-intelligence-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning AI Forum NZ - Shaping a Future New Zealand https://aiforum.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AI-Report-2018_web-version.pdf Autonomous Agents An intelligent Agent operating on an owner's behalf but without any interference of that ownership entity.

The aim is to broadens their perspective and force them to challenge their own biases and conventions in favor of approaches that align to the people’s goals, needs and pain-points. See also Personas Archetypes are based on research data, and focus on user behavior and motivation, and many believe they are more useful than personas for defining experiences. The aim is to empower your team to immerse themselves in what the customer is doing and what they desire to achieve, resulting in a more accurate UX strategy, and creating a stronger foundation for the project overall. Archetypes are steeped in user behavior. They contain details from user interviews around a group’s needs, motivations and pain-points. Archetypes focus on the “who does what, when they do it, and why” of your audience research. They provide insight into behavior patterns – how a customer is using a product or service currently. Backlog The backlog, also known as product backlog is a prioritised list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product and is referenced daily by the scrum team to determine what they need to work on next. The product owner is responsbile in ensuring the backlog/product backlog is kept up to date and has all the right information in there for the scrum team use to complete a task. The content is broken up into a story and are prioritised for the scrum team. The product backlog is living and will be constantly changing and evolving on a daily basis and is never complete. https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-product-backlog https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/backlog/ Backlog Grooming See backlog refinement for further information See backlog refinement for further information Backlog Refinement Also known as backlog grooming. Backlog refinement is when the product owner and some or all of the team review what's coming in the next sprint Backlog refinement is when the product owner, with some or all of the scrum team review the backlog. This gives the scrum team the opportunity to look at what features are likely to come up in the next sprint. It's also an opportunity to make sure they are prioritised correctly, that they have everything required to deliver that feature prior to sprint planning. It also means that if there are still questions, then the product owner can resolve these ahead of sprint planning. https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/product-backlog-refinement-grooming https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/backlog-grooming/ Beta (phase of Lab workflow model) Developing a service to meet demands of a live environment, including understanding how to build and scale the service while continuously make improvements to meet user needs. Building a fully working service based on the Alpha - this may involve adding/modifying features based on evaluation and design roadmap. This is done in close partnership with government agencies and their technology partners, and includes iterative releases of working versions of the service to the public. At this stage the product will need to meet standards and policies for things like privacy, security and accessibility. https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/strategy-and-planning/digital-lifecycle/ Bias (in computer/AI systems) Computer systems that systematically and unfairly discriminate against certain individuals or groups of individuals in favour of others. There are many sources of bias including (but definitely not limited to): - Preexisting Bias (bias that gets built into a software system because the organization determining the requirements for the software is biased. The software reflects their own bias) - Technical Bias (Technical bias emerges as a consequence of technical constraints or decisions. Limited space on a display, input devices, and specific algorithms can bias a system in one way or another) - Emergent Bias (Use of a software system changes over time. Through the addition of new users or new types or sources of data, bias can emerge in ways that are difficult - if not impossible - to predict when the system was built) Bias in Computer Systems https://vsdesign.org/publications/pdf/64_friedman.pdf Big data Extremely large data sets that can be analysed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations (often relating to human behaviour and interactions).

The (Google) Design Sprint was developed by Google Ventures based on a bunch of good practice from dSchool, IDEO etc. Design Sprints can vary in length - but care must be taken not to lose the benefits of their highly structured process. The Lab has run a number of three day design intensive sprints recently (16/10/2018). pre-production designs The Design Sprint http://www.gv.com/sprint/ https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/introduction/overview Design Thinking A set of mindsets and skillsets that can be used by anyone to examine and understand a problem and to drive better ideas and launch more experiments into the world. Design Thinking is based on the idea that the best way to learn is by doing, working on real problems in real time. The (Google) Design Sprint is a well known example of a multi-stage Design Thinking workshop. The Design Gym Digital Service Council (DSC) Established in 2013 (and replaced by SIWG in 2015) to provide governance to the Result 10 programme of work.

Encryption is used to help keep data private, both when it is transmitted across networks, and when it is stored. There are two common categories of encryption: 1) Aymmetric-key ciphers, also referred to as \"secret key,\" use a single key, sometimes referred to as a shared secret because the system doing the encryption must share it with any entity it intends to be able to decrypt the encrypted data. The most widely used symmetric-key cipher is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which was designed to protect government classified information. The challenge with this form of encryption is that the sender must exchange the key used to encrypt the data with the recipient before the recipient can perform decryption on the ciphertext. The need to securely distribute and manage large numbers of keys means most cryptographic processes use a symmetric algorithm to efficiently encrypt data, but they use an asymmetric algorithm to securely exchange the secret key. 2) Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses two different but mathematically linked keys, one public and one private. The public key can be shared with everyone (and is used to encrypt data), whereas the private key must be kept secret (as it is used to decrypt data which has been encrypted with the private key). The RSA encryption algorithm is the most widely used public key algorithm (the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) used by web browsers using the HTTPS protocol). This form of cryptography can also be used to ensure the integrity (was the data altered since being encrypted), authenticity (are you sure it came from the source you think it did) of data through the use of digital signatures. Emerging Tech Landscape: \"Encryption assists in protecting privacy. It turns sensitive information into “for your eyes only” that’s intended only for the parties that need to access it\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem) https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nonreputable#English https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/encryption End User Person who ultimately uses or is ultimately intended to use a deliverable (product, service, process etc). An end user is the person that a deliverable (service, software program, hardware device, product, process etc) is designed for - and who uses the deliverable after it has been fully developed (and potentially marketed, and installed). “Organisations should always keep the end user in mind when designing a new service”. \"Identify your users and understand their ongoing needs. - Conduct holistic research on the real needs of your users from their point of view and what that means for the design of the service...\" The Tech Terms Computer Dictionary https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/digital-service-design-standard/principles/#Principles-1 Engine (Software Engine) Software components an order of magnitude more complex than ordinary modules of software. Typically software modules pass data to a software engine and the engine transforms data into a different state. See also Calculator and Agent Examples of software engines include workflow engines, inference engines, search engines, and relational database engines. Normally software engines can be tuned - like a car engine (unlike less sophisticated software which requires refactoring to improve it). \"A game engine is a software development environment designed for people to build video games. Developers use them to create games for consoles, mobile devices, and personal computers.' \"Other examples of engines are Audio, Video, Image heavy processing engines and specialized proprietary rendering engines in Hollywood films which require lot of visual optimizations.\" Entity A thing with distinct and independent existence An entity is something that exists separately from other things and has a clear identity of its own. An entity can include an individual, business, device or system. Example: “Although Government buildings are in separate locations, Government is considered to be a single entity” Collins English Dictionary Epic A large feature written as a user story that needs to be broken down into more bite sized pieces of work and prioritised in the product backlog, that the scrum team use to deliver a product. An epic is a large user story or feature that cannot be delivered as defined within a single sprint or is large enough that it can be split into smaller user stories. It can also be represented by a short phrase instead of a user story depending on what it is. Epics give you the ability to track large, loosely defined ideas in the backlog without the need to overpopulate your backlog with multiple items, if the idea isn't fully formed yet. At the point that it's more formed you are able to break the epic down into smaller user stories and track against the delivery of the epic. Epic: As a user, I can backup my entire hard drive. User stories: As a power user, I can specify files or folders to backup based on file size, date created and date modified.

An estimation also informs how much work the scrum team think they can bring into a sprint and deliver within that timeframe. Estimation can be done a couple of ways, the most basic being tee shirt sizing (small, medium or large) or using Fibonacci. Estimation isn't a measure of time involved to deliver something, but the effort. Estimation is also known as story points, sizing. https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/estimation/ Federated Architecture (FA) A pattern in enterprise architecture that allows interoperability and information sharing between semi-autonomous de-centrally organized service providers. Modified from Wikipedia Federated Service Delivery (FSD) The working name of Result 10, Action 5. It is focused on taking a truly customer-centric view of delivering government services. Result 10 completed extensive customer research during which customers told us they experienced a lot of pain points when dealing with government services - including having to approach several different government agencies to get things done. Federated Service Delivery seeks to address these issues by putting customers at the centre of all government service delivery - removing artificial demarcations, particularly around significant life events such as having a baby or embarking on tertiary study. Federated Service Delivery is closely related to Result 10, Action 4 - \"Consolidate and rationalise the government web domain and rewrite service information to make transactions easier to find and use.\" See also Federated Architecture (FA) \"Agencies are being asked to apply a “federated services” model to integrate their services for customers but because there is no reference implementation for this, they are having to undertake the financial and technical risk in interpreting what it means.\" \"Federated services model: seamless digital services for users, consumable authoritative components (data, content, transaction services, business rules), personalisation?\" \"The DSC chose the ‘federated’ term deliberately to reflect the fact they were seeking to build a collaborative, distributed model of integrated services rather than a highly centralised model.\" Introducing Federated Service Delivery https://www.digital.govt.nz/blog/introducing-federated-service-delivery/ Draft Lab+ work plan (April - June 2017) https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16EY6o7udZFjp2DsFEPSZyvWKpS5AlCTv8wflRgPCj8s/edit?usp=sharing Hypothesis A provisional idea which is proven to be \"true\" or \"false\" through an experiment. If you believe something might be true but don’t yet have definitive proof, it is considered a theory (or hypothesis) until that proof is provided For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can verify or test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. In \"entrepreneurial science\", a hypothesis is used to formulate provisional ideas within a business setting. The formulated hypothesis is then evaluated where either the hypothesis is proven to be \"true\" or \"false\" through an experiment which is either verifiability or falsifiability oriented . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis For a very formal definition of hypothesis testing: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HypothesisTesting.html Hypothesis - Null Hypothesis A null hypothesis is the proposition that there is no cause and effect relationship between phenomena or populations. Using a null hypothesis is useful because it can be tested and found to be false, which then implies that there is a relationship between the observed data. It is much easier to disprove a hypothesis than to positively prove one. A common approach is to reject a null hypothesis if the observed data are significantly unlikely (stats definition) to have occurred if the null hypothesis were true. \"Hyperactivity is unrelated to eating sugar\" is an example of a null hypothesis. If the hypothesis is tested and found to be false, using statistics, then a connection between hyperactivity and sugar ingestion may be indicated. A significance test is the most common statistical test used to establish confidence in a null hypothesis.\" \"You may be wondering why you would want to test a hypothesis just to find it false. Why not just test an alternate hypothesis and find it true? The short answer is that it is part of the scientific method. In science, propositions are not explicitly \"proven.\" Rather, science uses math to determine the probability that a statement is true or false. It turns out it's much easier to disprove a hypothesis than to positively prove one. Also, while the null hypothesis may be simply stated, there's a good chance the alternate hypothesis is incorrect.\" Wikipedia https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-null-hypothesis-and-examples-605436 Information Data that has been processed, aggregated and organized into a more human-friendly format that provides more context.

Service Innovation Toolkit Insight Conclusions generated by analyzing information that can influence decisions and drive change. Design Insights are breakthroughs that reveal behavior patterns and drive bold decisions. By shedding light on behavior patterns, they can point design teams in new directions that would otherwise go unexplored. They are NOT observations, data or user wish or need. See also Data, Information, and Actionable Insight Data, information and insights are not synonyms. Data is raw and unprocessed facts, usually in the form of numbers and text. Information is data that has been processed, aggregated and organized into a more human-friendly format that provides more context. Insights are generated by analyzing information and drawing conclusions. Design Insights can shape a project during any point in the product development process by revealing behavior patterns that are normally lost, hidden or obscured. By bringing these patterns in view, we can make observations and form connections between them, as well as predict future behaviors. This deep understanding of the true nature and motivations behind user behaviors prevents teams from going too far down wrong paths, and leads us to better ideas, better solutions, and ultimately better products/services. \"my Fitbit watch gives me all kinds of activity data: steps, BPM (heart beats per minute), and so on. If my watch says I’ve taken 7,442 steps today, this single fact is fairly useless, especially without more context - but my Fitbit app includes a number of data tables and visualizations (information) such as a weekly steps report where I can see how many steps I completed each day. When I analyze this trended information I can see my current trajectory is ahead of what I accomplished the past few days and with a little extra effort in the evening I can reach my daily target (insight: I only need 2,558 more steps in the next 5 hours to reach my daily target). https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentdykes/2016/04/26/actionable-insights-the-missing-link-between-data-and-business-value https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31721/actionable-insight https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight https://hbr.org/2012/09/metrics-are-easy-insights-are-hard https://zurb.com/design_insights https://thrivethinking.com/2016/03/28/what-is-insight-definition/ Internet of Things (IoT) Devices with the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. This includes (but isn't limited to!) cellphones, coffee makers, washing machines, headphones, lights, wearable devices, and components of machines (for example a car engine, or wheel bearing). IoT is a big topic at the moment because it can be applied both at a small scale (e.g. automating data collection from components in manufacturing to predict when they will fail), and to things like transportation networks and \"smart cities\" which can help us reduce waste and improve efficiency for things such as energy use. It has enormous potential to help us measure, understand, and improve how we work and live. Note: 1) A number of factors mean that the number of connected things is skyrocketing (Gartner estimatres by 2020 there will be over 26 billion connected devices, some say 100 billion). Big contibutors include the cost of connecting to the internet decreasing rapidly, and more and more devices being created with Wi-Fi capabilities (and sensors built in) - again due to costs coming down. 2) The \"internet\" in the name is misleading because devices may be connected in a home or factory via non-IP (internet) networks (such as \"ZigBee\") to a router. The impact of these connected devices is typically included when talking about IoT. 3) Many IoT devices use web protocols to communicate (these are a subset of the ways to communicate using the internet), but not all do. Emerging Tech Landscape: \"Network-enabled smart devices that use embedded processors, sensors and communication hardware to collect, send and act on data they acquire from their environments\" https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/05/13/simple-explanation-internet-things-that-anyone-can-understand/#b07ea0d1d091 Lean Canvas A strategic tool to synthesise business, project or product ideas on to one (typically A3) page. A tool used as part of lean startup methodology for developing products, which aims to shorten product development cycles (and achieves this by adopting a combination of hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and validated learning). \"A key focus of the Lean Canvas is on understanding the problem to be solved. Most products (product companies) fail, not because they fail to build what they set out to build, but because they waste time, money, and effort building the wrong product. A huge conttibutor to this is a failure to understand the problem at the start.\" Wikipedia https://blog.leanstack.com/why-lean-canvas-vs-business-model-canvas-af62c0f250f0 Life Event A life event is a major event or related series of events that change a person's status or circumstances. Examples of life events include giving birth, marriage, divorce, death of spouse, or loss of a job. When customers contact government in the course of a life event (eg enrolling for tertiary education) they do so in order to achieve a task or goal greater than the scope of individual agency services. Federated Services Delivery Glossary Logic Mapping (Game Design) Logic mapping is a game design tool applicable in a design situation dealing with complex issues that require systemic design or redesign. Logic mapping reveals the common threads running through audience experiences. It helps to identify commonalities around issues and motivations, shared between different groups. It aids decision making by revealing the most impactful area where action can be focused. The Logic Mapping process evolved out of research into the application of positive psychology for the design of serious games.

Kanban was originally developed for Toyota's manufacturing arm and would resupply products based on customer demands. Over the years this has been repurposed to use with a variety of different teams who want to be able to manage their work in progress with the ability to pull work into their workflow when they need it. Kanban allows organisations and teams to start with their existing workflows and drive a change on how they deliver work. It creates transparency of the work in progress and allows teams to be able to stop starting and start finishing work. Kanban is another framework utilitised by Agile. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/kanban/ Minimum Viable Product (MVP) A product with just enough features for you to test it with users and check whether those features work (and gather meaningful feedback). Multiple prototypes may be created within a Design Discovery or Alpha phase to inform and refine a product of Alpha quality (the MVP). Note that producing a product of Alpha quality differs from running an Alpha phase. Proof of concepts and prototypes are usually developed and tested within a controlled environment – such as in a workshop or lab workplace – although some prototypes are tested out in the field. Pilots and MVPs, on the other hand, are usually tested in the real world. Note: there are many sources which reference the (in)famous Dropbox video as an MVP. While the video was a clever way of communicating a concept and gauging interest, the video was not a working product, and therefore not an MVP. \"remember DropBox’s first MVP was a video and there are many more similar examples\" \"Are you looking for purely a build of an MVP (defined by GDS Service Manual as \"just enough features for you to test it with users and check whether those features work\"), or a full alpha with user testing and refinement?\" \"The minimum viable product is that version of a new product a team uses to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.\" Australian Digital Transformation Office https://ausdto.github.io/service-handbook/alpha/4-finishing-alpha/4-1-defining-mvp.html UK Government Service Manual https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works https://states-of-change.org/stories/proof-of-concept-prototype-pilot-mvp-whats-in-a-name Hackney Council - Creation of an MVP of the digital service for Ways into Work (see questions) https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/2274 Wikipedia https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/proof-of-concept-prototype-pilot-mvp-whats-in-a-name/ Mixed Reality (MR) The merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time. Mixed reality not only overlays, but anchors virtual objects to the real world, and allows the user to interact with the virtual objects. Mixed reality is generally (26/10/2018) experienced via a headset such as the MS Hololens or Magic Leap. aka hybrid reality Wikipedia Pattern Language A pattern language is a method of describing good design practices within a field of expertise. The term \"pattern language\" was coined by architect Christopher Alexander and popularized by his book A Pattern Language. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language The notion of patterns has been adopted by IT to describe good design practices for providing computer systems. Federated Services Delivery Glossary Persona A representation of a key audience segment used as a design tool to create empathy with a group of real users mixing demographic information with archetypal behaviors in a believable format. See also Digital Identity - Persona and Behavioural archetypes Good personas are a reliable and realistic representation of audience segments for reference based on qualitative + quantitative user research - often including web analytics. They help the team avoid designing a product from a client-as-customer or us-as-customer perspective. The challenge/weakness with personas can be that they focus on characteristics, and are often created with little insight into the behavior of the people they represent – which opens the door to assumptions by your project team. Personas include demographic details such as age, gender, occupation, education, interests, etc - so they are useful to provide insight into the characteristics of a target audience - but may not include details on behavioral patterns (compare Behavioural Archetypes). \"Personas help to focus decisions surrounding site components by adding a layer of real-world consideration to the conversation. They also offer a quick and inexpensive way to test and prioritize those features throughout the development process.\" https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html Archetypes not Personas - Pivotal Labs https://medium.com/interactive-mind/archetypes-not-personas-2e32c8306112 https://smashingideas.com/behavioral-archetypes/ https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-you-should-find-your-archetype-not-your-persona_us_59b592bfe4b0c50640cd6879 Product Backlog The Product Backlog, also known as Backlog is a prioritised list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product and is referenced daily by the scrum team to determine what they need to work on next. The product owner is responsbile in ensuring the backlog/product backlog is kept up to date and has all the right information in there for the scrum team use to complete a task. The content is broken up into a story and are prioritised for the scrum team. The product backlog is living and will be constantly changing and evolving on a daily basis and is never complete. Product Owner (Rangitira) The Product Owner holds the vision for what the scrum team are delivering and ensuring that the maximum of value in a sprint is being delivered. The Product Owner (PO) is one of three roles within a Scrum team. The PO holds the vision/value for the project/product and communicates this back to the scrum team and makes sure that they are delivering to the vision. The PO will have a deep understanding on who will be using the the product, but they don't determine how much work the scrum team will do in a sprint or change the goals - but they will determine what the team need to do and controls the backlog for the project. A PO needs to be readily available to the scrum team in order for the team to deliver to the vision. https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/roles https://www.scrumalliance.org/agile-resources/scrum-roles-demystified Production Technologies Machines that create a tangible physical product that a business can use or sell.

Emerging Technology Landscape Retrospective (Titiro whakamuri) A session where an Agile team reflects on performance to date, and creates a plan for improvements to be made within the next iteration or Sprint. The scrum team meets regularly, usually after the end of each sprint. This time is used to reflect on the most what the sprint team determine were the most significant events/problems that occured during the sprint. They unpack the events/problems that occurred and work together to make and take decisions/experiments to either resolve the issue or take steps to see if they can improve on the issue. The retrospective is facilitated generally by the scrum master. There are several different approaches for running a retrospective and these sessions can also be tailored to themes that may have come up throughout the sprint. The retrospective meeting can typically run from one to four hours. With the meeting being facilitated it gives the opportuity for everyone on the sprint team to have a voice and be able to speak up. https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/heartbeatretro/#q=~(infinite~true~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video~'aa_podcast)~tags~(~'retrospective))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1) Robotics The design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. The development of machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations and for lots of purposes, but have to date most commonly been used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive.

An assessment about whether the Lab should proceed with the project based on considerations such as whether the Lab is well positioned to add value, and whether the team/agency/interested party are ready to engage and commit with the Lab and its processes. The output from this stage is a (rapid) decision about whether the project will become part of the work-programme, and what the next step (after Project Scoping which always follows immediately) should be (e.g. Research Discovery or Alpha). This decision is made based by the Lab leadership team based on a one-page document.

Scrum is a framework (with principles and practices) that helps teams to work through complex adaptive problems, by breaking them down into small features that are be delivered in small managable pieces in short timeframes or sprint's. This approach allows for fast feedback, and the opportunity to review as a team how they work together and identify areas they need to improve. By the end of the sprint the team should be delivering features or products of the highest value and features or products that do 'just enough' to get the job done. the scrum team self organises on a daily basis with a stand-up, there are regular backlog refinement sessions, sprint planning, retrospectives to allow for transparency and support to remove anything stopping them from completing a feature or story.

The Scrum Master's role is to protect the team from distractions and helping them remove any 'blocks' they might have to achieving the goal of the sprint. The Scrum Master will also work closely with the team to ensure the Scrum is being applied correctly. The difference between the role of project manager and scrum master is that the scrum master allows the team to self organise and come to their own decisions and supports the product owner with the handling of reports and budgets. The project manager retains command and control over the team and handles all the reporting and budgeting associated with a project. https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum-master Scrum team The core team that will deliver the project or product that is being worked on. The scrum team is one of three roles within the scrum. They are a a cross functional team who are self organising and have been formed to delivier a project. There are a range of different disciplines that might be involved, such as: product owner, scrum master, designers (UX / UI), developers, testers, business analysts. Some of these team members will be part of the scrum for the duration of the project, others will come and go as they are required.

Sprints are generally fixed in duration for the length of a project, and are typically 1-2 weeks, but can be longer. A Sprint typically starts with sprint planning that defines a sprint backlog (identifying the work for the sprint) and a sprint goal. Each sprint ends with a sprint review/showcase to show progress to stakeholders, and a sprint Retrospective. Scrum places a real emphasis on having a working product (or new set of features) at the end of the sprint. In the case of software, this is likely to mean that software has been fully integrated, tested and documented, and is potentially shippable. Wikipedia Sprint Backlog The sprint backlog is the subset of product backlog that the sprint team targets to deliver during a sprint to acheive the sprint goal and the feature /product they are working towards to deliver The sprint backlog is the subset of product backlog that the sprint team targets to deliver during a sprint to acheive the sprint goal and the feature /product they are working towards to deliver. The sprint backlog is agreed by the sprint team at sprint planning. The sprint backlog is then represented on a digital or physical board to create visibility and transparency of what the team are working on. The items in the backlog are what the sprint team focuses on for that sprint and all work should be represented there. If new work is identified as part of the sprint, the sprint team have a discussion on the requirements and agree whether it can be bought into the sprint and agree what can drop out of the sprint. https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/sprint-backlog https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-backlog https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/scrum-tools/sprint-backlog Sprint Board (Papa Kōrero) The sprint board tool that sprint teams use to make their sprint backlog items visible.

This is used in conjunction with the daily stand-up that helps team remain focused on the work at hand. In it's basic form it creates a workflow that gives the sprint team the ability to pull new work into their workflow. Generally this is made up of the following columns which the sprint team can pull a story into. Backlog (the work that needs to be done) Doing (the work that is currently in progress) Blocked (work can't be completed due to something stopping this) Review (ready for the product owner to review or other members of the team) Done (work is approved and completed) Sprint Planning Sprint planning is an event held on the first day of the new sprint.

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told (usually) from the perspective of the person who desires the new feature/item - generally at user or customer of the the work you are delivering. They are generally written in the voice of the customer and will include acceptance criteria required to deliver that story. User stories usually follow a template: As a type of user , I want some goal so that some reason . A story is written for a small piece of work that can be completed independently from any of the other stories in the sprint backlog or product backlog. Each story has it's own 'card' that is represented on the sprint board. Acceptance Criteria is additional information that provides the sprint team with more detail about how benefits will be delivered as part of this work being done and something for the product owner to check against when that story has been worked on and that work is ready to be reviewed. Stories are sometimes broken down further into tasks e.g. the steps required to complete the story. Anyone on the sprint team can write the stories, they are generally reviewed and prioritised by the product owner. The user stories relate directly back to the epic's that the sprint team are delivering for. Epic: As a user, I can backup my entire hard drive. User stories: As a power user, I can specify files or folders to backup based on file size, date created and date modified. As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved. https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story https://www.boost.co.nz/blog/2018/06/user-stories-in-scrum Virtual reality (VR) An experience which immerses users in a fully artificial digital environment.

It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes can be run on a public cloud service or on-premises, is highly modular, open source, and has a vibrant community. Kubernetes aims to provide a \"platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts\". It works with a range of container tools, including Docker. Companies of all sizes are investing in Kubernetes. Many cloud providers offer Kubernetes as a service (including Amazon, Azure, and Catalyst Cloud). Applications deployed on Kubernetes can be easily moved from one cloud provider to another because Kubernetes provides a consistent \"layer\" which avoids the danger of getting locked in to one cloud provider by relying on their particular set of services. As of 5 November 2018, Kurbernetes is the market leader in this space. \"Docker is a platform and tool for building, distributing, and running Docker containers.

It was co-designed and co-delivered by the Service Innovation Work Programme Team in the Department of Internal Affairs, in partnership with Assurity Consulting Ltd along with support and direction from the Service Innovation Reference Group. It provided a place where teams of people from different agencies, NGOs, private sector and New Zealanders can be co-located in a physical space conducive to collaboration and experimentation, supported by skilled lean and agile coaches who can help teams rapidly evolve their working methods. Key Points Lab as a space (based outside of government) External expertise (procured) Time-limited Senior Support: SIWG and SIRG Cross government focus Prototyping new ways of working across government Case Studies Channel and Service Strategy: Discovery Phase (27 March-28 April) - Supporting agencies to develop effective channel and service strategies. The work was undertaken by a small team who identified that the level of maturity in agencies with regard to agency channel and service strategies is uneven. Innovation Toolkit to support people in agencies collaborate and innovate - Provide a range of service innovation tools, mechanisms, ways of working, templates and methodologies that can be used to support innovative multi agency and community-wide initiatives. Lab tours and showcases - More than 40 requests for Lab tours were received, over 300 people from over 35 public and private sector agencies and organisations visited the Lab. There was interest from not only Wellington, but also visitors and “virtual visitors” from Christchurch, Auckland, Tauranga, Greymouth and the UK, US and Australia. Context Better Public Services agenda Increased expectation that agencies will collaborate and work in joined-up ways Increased interest in human-centred approaches across government Importance of digital services and digital identity amplified Quotes “We couldn’t have made this progress in this way if it weren’t for the Lab” “It has been a change in approach and in the way the team interacts, more agile, less hierarchical and definitely faster.” “The neutral zone was helpful in terms of atmosphere. It didn’t feel like Headmaster watching you.” Phase 3 - LabPlus (Lab as a Service Jul - Jun 2018 Summary Building on the lab as a space concept, Lab+ extended the offer beyond a space to include an in house service offer back to agencies. It focused on life-events and integrated services with a digital focus. A work programme and further funding was approved by the lab’s cross-government governance group. This iteration brought together staff from across government to work on a new way of delivering government services. A number of key projects that progressed to implementation. Other pieces laid the foundations and secured buy-in for further work. A number of barriers also began to emerge which were presented to sponsors. Key Points Increased internal capability and expertise. Reduced need for external expertise 12-month work programme Focus on life events and integrated services Senior Support and resources Work supplemented by future-thinking e.g. Emerging Tech workstream Case Studies SmartStart - SmartStart was the first “life event service” to be delivered by the New Zealand Government. The project made it easier for New Zealanders having a baby to navigate their way around government services and to access services in an integrated manner. The lab contributed to the design and development of the SmartStart platform plus helped foster cross-agency collaboration. SmartStart Rates Rebate - The lab team worked alongside the Department of Internal Affairs Service Delivery and with different local New Zealand councils to improve the experience for people claiming rates rebates. Improving uptake of the rebate was an opportunity to put money back to low-income households. Rates Rebate Victim of Crime Life Event support - This Discovery work was led by Police with support from the Lab. Early discovery led to prototyping ways to better inform victims of support services. The project highlighted the challenges and complexities of prioritising user needs and value versus what is expedient. Victim of Crime Life Event Context General election and change of government - Oct 2017 Work on government’s 100-day plan took priority over lab work Team moved offices 3 times in 12 months - inc emergency decant Set up of dedicated lab space a positive outcome Quotes Phase 4 - Lab: Space & Service Jun 2018 - Sept 2019 Summary This phase sought to embed work to make it easier for people to access /use government services.The SI lab offered both a physical space and a multi-disciplinary team with 18 months experience innovating inside government. Work on integrated services continued but some of the barriers to collaboration identified in phase 2 persisted. The team’s work was increasingly valued for the Capability uplift it enabled. Both around collaboration and Emerging tech expertise. Key Points Lab as a space (based outside of government) External expertise (procured) Time-limited Senior Support: SIWG and SIRG Cross government focus Prototyping new ways of working across government Case Studies Wheturangitia project - In response to the lack of support for parents, families and whānau who had suffered the death of a child during pregnancy, at birth, or during infancy. The lab supported The Life Events Team, Ministry of Justice, Inland Revenue and Sands (a non-profit baby loss support organisation) and Catalyst IT to develop an online support resource. Croissant Development - Croissant is a feedback analysis engine and web-based presentation application developed from an earlier project with the Ministry for Youth Development. Croissant ensures large quantities of feedback submitted in diverse channels and formats can be quickly, efficiently, consistently and accurately synthesised, and presented in a way that best assists policy analysts to advise decision makers. It quickly develop a wider use for team needing to enrich and contextualise analysis of feedback, research and other forms of textural analysis. Croissant Hosting NZ police - For X months during 2019, the Lab hosting a project team from NZ Police working on XXXXX. The team were in need of a dedicated workspace that supported project work and a creative environment. There was less need for wrap around support from the Lab team but collocation led to opportunities share ideas, approaches and connect with other team in the lab space. Context Better Public Services agenda Increased expectation that agencies will collaborate and work in joined-up ways Increased interest in human-centred approaches across government Importance of digital services and digital identity amplified Quotes Phase 5 - Close & Transition Oct 2019 - Jun 2020 Summary In late 2019 it was decided that The Service Innovation Lab (the Lab) would close on 30 June. The decision was part of the transition to creating a more customer-centred digital government within the Department of Internal Affairs. Much of the work programme will continue but be led by the relevant lead agencies, Digital Public Service branch or other teams in DIA. The transition period coincided with the arrival of Covid-19 in early 2020. The wider government response and need to work remotely under level 3 and 4 enabled the Lab to help other teams by sharing its experience of agile and digital collaborative practice. The team was also able to continue delivering the lab’s work programme. Key Points Case Studies Financial Calculator tool - This cross-agency project established a Covid 19 financial help tool in response to low understanding from Employees, Employers and self-employed about what they and their staff would qualify for under the Covid 19 wage subsidy scheme. The online platform was rapidly developed during the early stage of the lock down with a strong focus on navigating the authorising environment to get tool released and available to people. Coaching and modelling remote collaborative working - The lab story has highlighted its resilience to change and ability to adapt. It has has extensive experience of online collaborative tools and apply agile principles to its work. As other teams were adapting to remote working the lab’s experience enabled it to provide coaching and support where helpful. This includes the using of video conferencing tools, planning tools like Trello, plus capturing real time learning through retrospective sessions. Community Service Card project - Work focused on better understanding the user and system level issues related to the Community Services Card (CSC system).

The Lab The Government Service Innovation Lab of Aotearoa New Zealand, hosted by the Department of Internal Affairs, is one of these “makers” pockets that found a way in government and bring within it an ability to do disruptive innovation. These are not to be confused with other administration modernisation and innovation departments that focus on optimising internal processes. These more recent initiatives indeed leverage one specific way of modernising: they focus on the interactions between citizens and the administration. They aim at delivering high-grade, user-centred public digital services, in the open, within strong resources constraints. While counterintuitive at first, other countries have demonstrated the efficiency of this practice, and now recognise delivering services as the best strategy to improve agencies processes, driven by actual usage. The main similar initiatives around the world1 are gov.uk (UK, GDS2, 20113), 18F (US, GSA, 2014), beta.gouv.fr (France, DINSIC, 2015) and Team Digitale (Italy, AgiD, 2016). Assets Team As for all of these other international examples, the primary asset of the Lab (if not its entirety) is a very motivated, talented, interdisciplinary and genuine team with a bold and visionary leader. The central role of such servant leaders is to empower their colleagues by acting as a “brick umbrella,” protecting them as much as possible from whatever the layers of bureaucracy above throw at them, allowing the positive and rewarding environment in which resilient and adaptable teams thrive. Such units leverage best engineering practices (continuous integration, continuous delivery, cloud hosting…) to ensure reliability and quality despite very constrained resources. Lab meeting, DIA, Wellington, 2018 Capability The Lab team has secured these elements for a few months and is now equipped with excellent delivery examples such as the Rates Rebate or SmartStart apps. These elements will build the mana of that team across and beyond agencies, giving it more ability to engage partners, in turn offering more delivery opportunities, in a self-reinforcing loop. The primary value proposition of Lab-like initiatives is an ability to deliver, thus demonstrating it is crucial to both growth and sustainability, and this one is well on its way. Risks Low leverage Even while demonstrating its value, I believe that the Lab is currently too far away from central power to have a strong impact. All other successful examples I found, including all the ones cited earlier, are at most at tier 3 from Prime Minister or equivalent authority. Innovation is about taking risk. By definition of bureaucracy, layers of hierarchy are there to mitigate risk. Even with the best umbrella, it is impossible to do visible, engaging disruptive innovation under mattresses. The first reason is that of the sheer amount of advocacy work that needs to be done by a team with already limited resources. The second is because a successfully delivered digital public service does not have the same inspirational impact on other agencies if it is “that DIA department” that did it or if it is “the GDS Ministerial Lab.” Status is an influential —and sometimes mandatory— element to diffuse innovation in a bureaucracy and engage non-cooperative actors. Under-resourcing The Lab will be unable to scale as such. It already operates over capacity, and funding uncertainty prevents investment. Since its team is made of people used to work within strong constraints, the risk is not so much of disrupting current operations or of limiting delivery ability; the actual risk is of burning out the team. Beyond the human impact, that would also mean a wasted investment: people who are competent in both their skills and government ways take a long time to grow. It is worth noting, however, that it is a recurrent pattern for these very innovative teams to be at first ignored —or even mistreated— by their host agency until their value is impossible to deny. All of these now “famous” labs have their own horror stories of uncertainty and defensive struggles. I explain this by metrics mismatch: since they bring disruptive innovation abilities within government, the bureaucracy is not equipped to measure their effort and impact: there is no massive budget, no 100-pager to read in the cabinet, no 3-year outsourcing contract that are the usual signs of “big things.” Working software as the primary measure of progress, while indisputable for agile practitioners, is invisible for the administration until the value brought is too visible to deny that the problem is in measuring impact, not in having it. The temporary Lab office after earthquake-prone offices had to be evacuated, DIA, Wellington, 2018 I recommend focusing on delivery as the primary strategy, as funding will either be cut entirely at some point or finally recognised as the necessary fuel for a new way to deliver public digital services, and that second option can only happen by demonstrating how cost-effective that way can be by operating in the current constraints. Scope creep A recurrent temptation for makers who face administrative friction when changing one agency’s processes is to take up another challenge while waiting for the slower-paced political plays to unfold. Avoiding this is not possible nor desirable, as it is a sign of the entrepreneurial mindset that is precisely sought in such initiatives, and often yields unforeseen benefits4. However, the risk is to then expand the team’s responsibility to maintain or keep exploring too far, putting an even stronger strain on limited resources. The current Lab scope seems too broad to be sustainable regarding both resources and organisational readability. Trying to be present at the same time in delivery, future tech (AR/VR) exploration, system-wide strategy, citizen engagement…, while useful to identify political boundaries and strengths considering its young age, will not scale. Leaders that can engage makers must be visionary, which means that they sometimes can think too far ahead and overlook the burden of maintenance, prioritising investment over working budget. However, switching back to a managerial, accountant mindset is not the appropriate answer as it would very quickly disengage the team. I recommend to raise awareness of available resources, actual political engagements and associated funding streams, and to encourage and empower the team to take responsibility for their load from this information. Such a practice can limit scope creep while yielding the most innovation and fostering productivity. Aotearoa New Zealand government innovation landscape The Lab operates in a broader government innovation ecosystem. Beyond organisations, this section also takes an anthropological lens to characterise the inherent strengths and weaknesses of the cultural environment in which agencies operate. Principal Assets The principal assets I have identified for Aotearoa New Zealand to innovate in government lie in its ability to go beyond silo mentality by sharing vision and resources both across executive-operational layers and across the public, private and community sectors. Nimble government Even though civil servants might not all feel action is fast enough, I have consistently observed a relatively short, 2 to 3 weeks time from first exposure to first action towards implementation of a new idea, practice or tool. Delays of two months are common in continental France and can be even longer in overseas territories. Frictionless operational communication I have observed a distinctive kiwi positive communication style, with people genuinely reinforcing each other’s worth and value brought to a project. This could merely be a different way of expressing judgement5, but I attribute to this style an ability to engage on an operational level with less effort. With less risk of being shunned, agents from lower tiers feel more confident in joining a conversation. Similarly, Aotearoa New Zealand has the lowest professional gender bias of all countries I have observed. Since diverse operational insights are one of the basic needs for system innovation, this ability to engage is a definite asset. Bigger bureaucracies tend to make it mandatory to inaugurate discussions through higher tiers, or even to prevent them until they establish a formal working group. Such a silo and layered mentality prevents serendipity and thus innovation. “All-of-government” All-of-government gives the conceptual, sourcing and partly practical basis for collaboration across agencies. Even with no extensive use of all-of-government contracts, the simple use of the term “all-of-government” as a shared notion makes it very simple for agents to state when they are willing to work beyond their agency’s boundaries and to quickly assess if their counterparts are as well. In most countries, these practices have to be first established through peer-to-peer agreements, increasing the time to first meaningful collaboration. Digital 7 operational relationships The network of (self-proclaimed) “most advanced digital nations” D5, now expanded to D7, provides an excellent venue for sharing experience. Considering the natural duplicability of software and the commitment of these nations to work open-source, participation yields an extremely cost-effective way to reuse digital components and good practices. Sharing stories of successes and failures also brings new ideas and can prevent mistakes from being repeated. Aotearoa New Zealand is culturally ideally positioned to benefit from such exchanges: it speaks the global English language, which ensures it masters communication and can access most information; yet it comes with a multicultural and multilingual understanding perspective thanks to its Maōri component, which helps it avoid falling into the trap of underestimating cultural relativity. The USA in contrast, speaking only English, have access to as much information but have a tendency to dismiss other nations’ experience at the first sign of cultural mismatch rather than listening to the whole story and then extracting the pieces that make sense in their context. Concerned network of private actors With an understanding of the reputation of Aotearoa New Zealand as a clean, safe and socially conscious country as a shared asset, most private actors6 are more aligned with government objectives than in countries where the distribution of responsibilities simplistically opposes a right to regulate against a right to act until regulated. Community-conscious initiatives thrive and can quickly become partners of central and local government. As co-design is a crucial part of user-centred innovation and peer-to-peer diffusion an ingredient of adoption, this ease to work across legal entities is a strong asset. Innovation agencies operating in countries where the administration is considered as corrupt or as an enemy spend a significant part of their resources compensating for reputation deficit when engaging with private actors and individuals. Quest for clarity All stakeholders of an action, be it standard service delivery or significant process change, seem to look for a clear understanding of why they are engaging in an activity. Artefacts (posters, flyers…) stating and reinforcing end goal visions are omnipresent, and ceremonies (team meetings…) are used to that effect as well. Since radical innovation, by profoundly changing processes, can only pay off with alignment across layers, the familiar presence of tools and practices for diffusing vision is a definite asset. In countries that take a top-down approach to action, operational agents training to follow a process rather than being engaged in it hinder change initiatives. The Lab front door, Wellington, 2018 Main Risks The main risks I have identified that can hinder government innovation lie in missing the tools to challenge the status quo. Consensus over action Innovation is all about questioning ingrained habits and processes, and while its construction should be collaborative, its impact will by definition change the way stakeholders work. The flip side of positive communication is that it can be hard to distinguish clearly between enthusiasm to participate and actual commitment or to go through productive conflicts, which can then limit the ability to act on known problems. Waiting for all actors to be fully aligned with a vision prevents experimentation from happening, while the result of said experimentation would often be the most effective demonstration. Any strategy is only worth as much as the ability to deliver upon it. In the UK, the strategy was very clearly stated: “digital by default” and “assisted digital” make for such strong directions that they are now the Digital Service Standard. But only by following “the strategy is delivery” could these have any actual impact. Funding instruments and ambition mismatch If the ambition for innovation in government is to have public digital services delivered in an agile, user-centred and experimentation-based fashion, then competitive funding is counter-productive. Innovative products are best produced within short timeframes by small teams of people who typically don’t have a lot of capacity or interest for long descriptions and plans —which is why they are the best fit for “de-bureaucratising” processes on behalf of end users in the first place. This fact implies that public innovation is best funded by small grants given to agencies with concrete use cases and strong teams. To ensure doing gets an advantage over planning, application to these funds should have an aggressive, unusual format that aligns with the expected result. In the USA, 18F engages very early, by email, and expects the problem to be defined collaboratively. In France, the State Startups Incubator only works with agencies that have identified a civil servant intrapreneur providing a one-page product description7. Underrating of public digital infrastructure Offering capability to the economic and community components of society does not mean having an empty government. On the contrary, stable infrastructure yields more benefits to all. If Aotearoa New Zealand is to position itself as an “information society,” it is critical that it recognises the need for the digital infrastructure that will enable this. Just like sewage and roads are critical water and transport systems that allow healthy communities and strong economic actors, a knowledge-work society needs strong, maintained and up-to-date pipes and hygiene. This starts by ensuring agencies consider software as an asset, not a liability. And continues by providing a robust and secure network of connectivity and hosting providers, which can be public or private, but that should all be within New Zealand sovereignty area. This notion of public digital infrastructure should also extend to data. France has for example pioneered the notion of “public data service,” identifying nine datasets as being critical for agencies and companies alike, and enshrining their availability and quality in legislation. A long-standing piece of infrastructure: the railway station, Wellington, 2018 ICT strategy recommendations This set of recommendations builds upon the previous observations, as well as on my reading of strategy documents, participation in an ICT strategy co-design session, and interviews with participants before and after it. It aims at complementing and influencing the current directions, not replacing them. Focus on capability An important area of focus for the current ICT strategy is rephrasing elements that were already discussed under the previous government. While political alignment is a manifest necessity for public action, a strategy that aims at enabling delivery and transformation should affirm focus on impact and capability mapping to embody the priority given to investment and action. The time for government as a platform is now Actually, it was yesterday. Platform economics are already ruling the world of knowledge work. New relationships have to be built between government, economy, and society. Every day that passes where the government keeps policing through only regulation and strategies rather than building enabling platforms is more power flowing away to the GAFAMs and a lost opportunity to the people of Aotearoa New Zealand. Parliament House with national flags, Wellington, 2018 Such platforms should provide agencies, companies and individuals alike with APIs to interact with public services, interconnecting society components and providing governments with soft yet immediate and measurable power by regulating these platforms. Fund public innovation Create innovation funding instruments that allow other agencies to replicate the Lab’s achievements: small grants, small descriptions, small durations, big ambitions. And then shine the spotlight on these other agencies’ realisations. Larger-scale transformation funding would then be most effectively provided to agencies that have already demonstrated an ability to deliver smaller-scale services. Without implying that the exact same practices can be applied on any problem, there is a definite risk limitation in knowing that agents have first-hand experience with lightweight methods and fast delivery when tasked with updating large systems and processes. The Lab is one piece of the puzzle Use it to spearhead, demonstrate, engage, hire. The Lab will never deliver all public digital services, nor should it aim to. But it can be used to show what all agencies should try to emulate. Make it grow and evolve similar initiatives across central and local government, by getting Lab alumni to mentor them. Use the Lab reputation and skills to hire highly skilled digital professionals, and trust the Lab to facilitate their onboarding: it is the only part of government that speaks their language.

The Lab work is overseen by a cross agendy governance group, the Service Innovation Working Group with support from the Service Innovation Reference Group (which enables operational collaboration and leadership. Please also find an accessible mindmap of Lab deliverables and the draft Lab Lean Canvas. Exec Summary This is the final report for the 2017-18 financial year. All deliverables were completed as per the summary in this report. The team also explored the unique value proposition of the Service Innovation Lab which will help inform the cross agency governance bodies on what is best done through the Lab. We also explored emerging technologies and trends and their implications for government, we worked to always collaborate and enable greater innovation throughout the public service in the course of our work, and we explored system barriers and opportunities for genuine digital transformation of the NZ public sector. The Service Innovation Lab, working with agencies and partners across New Zealand, has certainly punched above its weight, and provides a good example of how genuine collaboration around shared goals can drive better outcomes for everyone. In June 2018, the Service Innovation Working Group (SIWG, the SI Lab funding and oversight governance body) approved to increase support for the Service Innovation Work Programme (including work done in and with the Lab) for work program initiatives agreed by the Service Innovation Reference Group (SIRG). This vote of confidence, especially in the absence of a mandate or requirement for agencies to fund the work program, speaks volumes about the confidence generated in the Service Innovation Lab and work program as a means for agencies to accelerate the design and delivery of better services for the people of New Zealand Aotearoa. The Service Innovation Lab is a credit to the Service Innovation Reference and Working Groups (our cross agency governance groups), the agency teams & partners who came together with the Lab around life events & proactive entitlements, and the dedicated Service Innovation team who have worked to deliver and support both an environment conducive to genuine collaboration, and a highly skilled workforce to support service innovation. Accomplishments The SIWG/SIRG endorsed work program deliverables - final report These were all the SIRG/SIWG agreed deliverables from the 12 months work program with status and links where relevant. Deliverables from July 2017 to 31 Dec 2017 Initiative Deliverable Services Register 1.0 (Family Services Directory based reusable component, initially for SmartStart use) Status: Complete. It was clear from early work in the Lab that a services register was a necessary reusable component for integrating information about services across different agencies for users. The first iteration for this reusable compoent was based on the user needs of SmartStart users to identify relevant family services near them. We worked with MSD to make the Family Services Directory fit for purpose for service delivery and available as an openly available API, courtesy of data.govt.nz. Links: The FSD reusable component, technical information and the reusable Directory Search Interface. Entering Tertiary Discovery (TEC) Status: Complete. This was such a broad potential scope that the Discovery turned into a Pre-Discovery to identify specific opportunities for service improvements and delivery for the myriad user needs identified in the process. It was a collaborative process involving the tertiary sector through TEC engagement, and helps inform the TEC work program. Links: Early blog post on the Pre-Discovery findings, an earlier “Better Choices” Design Sprint which helped inform the Pre-Discovery. The final report is published on the TEC website as a formal publication. API security model guidance Status: Complete and handed over to Government Enterprise Architecture group at GCDO (DIA). The Lab worked closely with the Government Enterprise Architect group in DIA to engage with API experts across government and the private sector on new guidance for consideration in the New Zealand API Guidance on ict.govt.nz. We tested the API guidance already in place, explored the needs of users, developers and agencies, we considered emerging trends and risks from non human actors (AI, software, machine to machine interactions) and handed the guidance over to GEANZ. We also ran an emerging technology showcase on APIs for service delivery to explore some of the considerations for agencies. Links: Exploring API Security, Emerging Tech: APIs for service delivery Rates Rebates Discovery Status: Complete. One of the opportunities identified from early \"Becoming a Senior\" life journey mapping that could immediately improve many people's interaction with government was a more proactively delivered Rates Rebate entitlement. This is a rates subsidy for low to middle income rate payers and a real pain for end users, for Councils and for Central Government. The Discovery drew on existing research and conducted new user research and a service design led approach to the entitlement both to solve this pain point, but also to explore the pattern of how government makes such entitlements more proactive. Links: The Rates Rebates Discovery Report, all Rates Rebates blog posts (see Alpha links in the 30 June deliverables list below). Digital ID transition early prototyping Status: Complete. The Lab team provided early support to the Digital Identity Transition team in exploring user and agency needs, including technical input and wireframing of concepts to test with users. Link: None, as was not able to be published at the time. Future work will be published. Service Innovation Toolkit 2.0 Status: Complete and continually improved. The first iteration of the Service Innovation Toolkit included useful guidance about Agile and Service Design methodologies which were included on the WebToolkit (now migrated to digital.govt.nz). We looked at the needs of service design and delivery teams and realised the teams needed 3 fundamental functions: 1) information and guidance (best practice, case studies, links, tools, up to date information on emerging trends, etc); 2) resource sharing (reports, user research, code and asset sharing, common patterns, etc); 3) collaboration (lists of communities of practice, means to collaborate, peer support and engagement). We also identified 4) access to sandpit tools would be greatly helpful to teams to reduce startup costs. We focused the first stage on the information/guidance needs and used a wiki to continually draw together information organically both to support teams, but also to provide a means of collaborating on service innovation. This pre-dated digital.govt.nz and will be revisited in the next financial year. Link: The Toolkit 2.0 (information sharing) is at http://serviceinnovationtoolkit.wikidot.com/ as a temporary collaboration tool. Service Analytics POC Design (user needs analysis) Status: Complete. Cross channel and possibly cross agency service analytics were identified as a high value evidence base to inform service design and delivery, to measure impact of new, changed or retired digital services, and to understand the user journey across channels and domains. This deliverable was to consult with agencies, learn their user needs around service analytics, design a basic POC and prioritise based on the agency needs. Link: The problem definition and early user needs report is here (2017), the POC report is here (2018). Emerging tech workshops (ongoing) Status: Complete and ongoing. We identified a need for service design and delivery teams to keep up with emerging tech and trends. We tried running an “Emerging Tech Showcase” which was heavily oversubscribed so have run these events every month or two, each focused on current tech and trends of interest. We have had over 600 attendees over the past 8 months. Links: The first Emerging Tech workshop with guests from the US & UK, all additional Emerging Tech showcase events linked here and includes AI, VR/AR/MR, APIs, measurement and other topics. Victim of Crime Life Event support (continued to 30 June 2018) Status: Complete. This Discovery work was led by Police with support from the Lab. Early discovery led to prototyping ways to better inform victims of support services, but due to complexity of the support services landscape across different entities, this work was pivoted in early 2018. Other options to support victims were explored with the stewardship group deciding to not progress at this stage. This is a good example of ensuring user needs and user value is prioritised over expediency, and all discovery work has been adopted by Police and other entities involved to help inform and improve a range of victim support services. Link: A final report is being prepared, however some blog posts are available with content about discovery insights and user needs. The work has continued to inform ongoing service design and delivery work across Police and their partners Public Facing Business Rules for SmartStart related entitlements (entitlements engine/legislation as code reusable component) Status: Complete after rolling over to June 30 deliverables. Another high value user need identified for SmartStart was the ability for people to more easily explore eligibility for services across agencies relevant to having a child. The Lab worked closely with the SmartStart team and their contractor as well as with IRD and MSD to deliver an Alpha “Financial Help” function on SmartStart, an indicative eligibility engine, on the back of a first iteration “legislation as code” reusable component. The rules were codified in a way that can be reused by other life events, and we explored multiple methods for encoding eligibility and calculation rules through APIs as a reusable component. This also inspired the Better Rules discovery sprint in January 2018 with IRD, MBIE, PCO and others. Links: The Financial Help functionality on SmartStart, the first iteration Eligibility Engine (based on the Australian Regulation as a Platform tool), the second iteration Eligibility Engine (based on OpenFisca, a French Government tool), and finally this work led to doing a cross agency Better Rules Discovery Report which explored legislation as code and codesign of policy/legislation for better public services. Common Delegations – options for End of Life & make previous work reusable Status: Complete. The earlier “Common/Central Delegations” prototype work conducted by DIA was reviewed and published publicly. It was found to be unfit for a reusable component in the existing state for several reasons: 1) it was too specifically tied to RealMe (an extension), 2) the functionality tried to serve all possible scenarios without actively being applied to any single use case, 3) it was too complex for existing life event requirements, 4) it is a relatively heavy Java application, which doesn’t easily sit alongside more modern web based development languages used by the life events to date, and 5) it was tied to the ForgeRock software stack, making it difficult for any other IAM to integrate. The software and final report were published with some clean up on the Service Innovation Lab github for future considerations, and the End of Life functionality requirements were met by their vendor in a much more lightweight way appropriate to user needs. Next steps is to assess delegations needs as they arise in life events/proactive entitlements work and start with extendable MVP. Links: Common Delegations Project Closure Report (Datacom), a Central Delegations Service prototype (Datacom), Using Wildfly Swarm Java EE microservice (Datacom). Consent based information sharing (publish generic data model and build MVP) Status: Complete. The “Consent based information sharing” project and MVP was moved from DIA back to MBIE where it has been rebranded “Business Connect”. The work done whilst at DIA continues to inform work around consent based information sharing when it arises as a functional requirement for life events and proactive entitlements however, we have also started exploring “verifiable claims” as an alternative to sharing personal data where a condition can be confirmed by a authoritative agency, negating the need for sharing or processing (such as a means test from IRD, or confirmation of age eligibility from DIA). We were able to publish the early draft “Generic Data Model” for consideration in our work and other service delivery teams. Links: The Common Data Model and the AoG Data model is here Deliverables from January to 30 June 2018 Initiative Deliverable Life events 1. ‘Entering Tertiary’ Alpha (TEC) - pivoted to Community Sservice Card (CSC) MVP Status: Complete. In consultation with TEC we pivoted to a CSC MVP based on previous user research work. TEC were not ready to proceed to an Alpha as originally planned and so candidates across the SIRG prioritised life events and proactive entitlements were considered by the Lab team as to viability with regards existing resources and research, value to users and prioritisation according to SIRG. We developed a working rough Alpha for Community Services Card (as opposed to a polished Alpha like in Rates Rebates) as a prototype to explore concepts from the earlier Discovery Sprint from Creative HQ and to test with agencies and potentially users, taking into account the pain points identified by relevant agencies in various meetings over the last 12 months. Next steps would be to work with agencies to iterate, test and explore possibilities in this space. Links: The MVP CSC demonstrator is available here. It is a mobile responsive tool based on the user need that people largely don’t know the value of getting a CSC. The MVP needs to be tested with users, agencies and to be included in a more formal discovery/alpha in collaboration with relevant agencies. The MVP is only a strawman to start discussions. Life events 2. Renting a Property Discovery (MBIE) Status: Completed. The Renting a Property Pre-Discovery work identified 9 distinct opportunities to improve the experience of tenants and landlords with better quality homes. It led to the design and development work starting to create an Alpha in the 2018-19 financial year. The team produced excellent outputs and the stakeholder engagement has been broad and effective. The team did user research in Auckland, Porirua and Whanganui. One participant from the Housing Commission commented that the 5 weeks work yielded greater insights and research than an entire year of someone preparing a thesis. It is the first life event discovery where we have explicitly tried to also map against the Intergenerational Wellness Framework which may be of interest to other agencies. The opportunities identified and concepts tested with end users (tenants, landlords, advocates and more) form a strong basis for moving into at least one Alpha in the next financial year. Links: links to come. Life events 3. Moving to NZ Discovery (INZ) - pivoted to Citizenship Status: Completed. The Lab ran a scoping session for INZ that resulted in internal initiatives being linked up around life event for INZ to focus on but they did not wish to proceed to a Discovery at that stage. The Discovery resourcing was then pivoted to Citizenship given the close relationship to the life event. The Citizenship team had already done a lot of process mapping and solution identification when they started with the Lab, The Discovery resourcing was used to focus on user journey research, pain points for agencies, and testing/validation of a solution proposed by DIA Citizenship service team. Alternative future modes of service delivery were also explored. Options for an Alpha were explored in preparation for the new financial year and an Alpha is planned for the new financial year. Links: No links, work is sitting with DIA Citizenship team. Life events 4. One other Pre-discovery and/or Discovery for a life event Status: Completed. The Lab team had a few candidates for this work and are finalising some scoping and pre-discovery work for both the proactive entitlement of immunisations with the Ministry of Health, as well as the proactive sharing of high risk offenders information from Corrections for staff safety across agencies. The more promising of the two will proceed to a full Discovery or Alpha (depending on availability of pre-existing user research and other planning) in the new financial year. Links: Reports are sitting with relevant departments for consideration of next steps. Proactive Entitlements 1. Rates Rebate Alpha. Status: Completed. The Rates Rebates Discovery led to a collaborative Alpha pilot with Tauranga City Council, with some interest, contributions and participation from Auckland, Wellington and other Councils. The first round of Alpha testing was well received by users with an up front eligibility test prior to applying, and then a streamlined application process which is almost entirely digital, as enabled by new legal advice regarding digital signatures from the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017. The Alpha was extended to test with a larger group of users till 30 September. Full Alpha Report to be published shortly thereafter. Links: Alpha Report to come, the Rates Rebates Alpha is available online here (until 30 Sept), all blog posts with previous research available here, and a blog about overcoming legislative barriers and our use of a digital signature is here. Proactive Entitlements 2. Support/Scoping for School and Startup Payments, Health entitlements and Paid Parental Leave Status: Complete. The SmartStart team have largely looked into this through their work, and the Lab team have provided some support, particularly around business rules of PPL, Best Start and other relevant entitlements. The Lab will have completed a some initial work on Immunisations which also feeds into this deliverable. Links: No relevant links, mostly a supporting role for this deliverable. Common components 1. Services Register extension Status: Complete. The first iteration of the Services Register done in 2017-18 Q2 provided the necessary functionality for the SmartStart “Services Near Me”. The extension work completed in Q3-4 included the development of a generic search interface as a reusable component, with first use cases including and MSD mobile app, govt.nz, Citizen Advice Bureau and Community Services Card. There was also some preliminary work looking at SuperGold Card as a next extension and identification of other service registers which could be included such as the HealthDirect catalogue. The generic search interface has been repurposed for two other initiatives thus far, namely a CSC rough alpha and Red Hat have taken it to use. Govt.nz are considering implementation of the search function for public use, and MSD are considering SuperGold as a next candidate for making the data available as a reusable component. Links: Family Services Directory Mobile demonstrator Emerging tech workshops (ongoing) Status: Complete and ongoing. We identified a need for service design and delivery teams to keep up with emerging tech and trends. We tried running an “Emerging Tech Showcase” which was heavily oversubscribed so have run these events every month or two, each focused on current tech and trends of interest. We have had over 600 attendees over the past 8 months. Links: The first Emerging Tech workshop with guests from the US & UK, all additional Emerging Tech showcase events linked here and includes AI, VR/AR/MR, APIs, measurement and other topics. Common components 2. Entitlement Rules/Legislation as Code reusable component Status: Complete to a functional MVP/Alpha phase. The entitlement rules required for a “Financial Help” function on SmartStart as well as eligibility for relevant services on any life event was completed with 18 initial entitlements and tax credits from MSD and IRD, with strong collaboration from both agency and approval on the approach, so long as it was caveated as an indicative eligibility engine, not authoritative or specific in terms of exact calculation. This was done and has been very successful. The initial rules engine was replaced by OpenFisca, A French Government tool for financial benefits and taxation eligibility, calculation and obligations modelling, and Best Start was also added along with updated for the 1st July changes that needed to be incorporated into SmartStart (with strong collaboration between the Lab, the SmartStart team and their vendor). The idea of computational rules of government led to the short 3 week Better Rules Discovery Sprint, a collaboration between IRD, MBIE, PCO, the Lab and an independent developer, which has been lauded as world leading and the basis for further work in New Zealand and with the D7. The rules engine was also used in a Hackathon for TechWeek with teams from private and public sectors participating in an exploration of legislation as code with results available at https://legalhackers.nz/betterruleshack/. Links: Financial Help on SmartStart, the 3 week Better Rules Discovery Sprint, and documentation about the reusable component. Common components 3. Streamlined application or notifications service Status: Complete. The Rates Rebates Alpha is a streamlined application service, built to be reusable for other application services. The team will be also further exploring notifications with upcoming life events. Links: The Rates Rebates Alpha is live till end of September and code available on github here. Common components 4. Common delegations or notifications service Status: Complete. See notes on Common Delegations from 31 December list above. Links: Common Delegations Project Closure Report (Datacom), a Central Delegations Service prototype (Datacom), and Using Wildfly Swarm Java EE microservice (Datacom). Reusable Components 5. Reusable code created from SmartStart Status: Complete. Previous SmartStart components were open sourced including a RealMe integration component and various reusable parts of the platform, some of which were reused in other Alpha work above making for faster more efficient development, ready for for reuse by other agencies and life events. Links: SmartStart has a frontend in reactjs, and a backend in django hosted on Catalyst’s cloud. There is also a Django app for integrating the RealMe authentication service. It was used for the SmartStart integrated services and is likely to be useful to many people integrating with Realme. There is also an analysis of SmartStart as a federated service. With thanks to Catalyst IT. Additional: Service Analytics POC - moving from design into a working Proof of Concept Status: Complete. A small POC to explore the viability of integrating service analytics across channels was explored in DIA (given the ready access to analytics data) using Citizenship and Marriage as two examples of life events for the purpose of exploration. The POC went well and the final report with screenshots and details is linked below. The results were very promising. Links: The problem definition and early user needs report is here (2017), the POC report is here (2018). Additional accomplishments Above and beyond the work delivered above, the Lab has had the following highlights and accomplishments. The Lab has been visited by subsequent Ministers of different governments in the 12 months of operation, demonstrating a high level of political interest and support of the work. Minister Clare Curran has explicitly named the Service Innovation Lab as her favourite example of GovTech in New Zealand. We hosted two booths at the D7 Showcase Event at the Beehive, one about life event services, and one with a 50 year future vision “optimistic future” presented in a virtual reality experience for the Minister & various senior officials from New Zealand and around the world. This was followed by a showcase at MBIE with two stands which were well populated by over 350 attendees. Tauranga City Council wrote to the DCE for Local Government at DIA, Ms Helen Wynn, praising the Rates Rebates work by the Lab and asking whether DIA will make it a national service. Auckland, Wellington, Ashburton and other Councils are also keen to get involved, and the relationships and trust built up now provide much greater opportunity for productive collaboration with Councils across the country. The Lab team facilitated a “National Age Friendly Communities” workshop for the Office of Seniors (MSD), generating ten agreed opportunities to improve the lives of senior citizens in New Zealand, and generation greater interest to work on the life event in the Lab. The “Better Rules” work done in collaboration with IRD, MBIE, PCO and a private sector company to explore the digital transformation of legislation and policy (including machine readable legislation as code) has generated extraordinary interest and support across the New Zealand Government, Councils, the Digital 7 nations, Law Foundation, World Bank and many others. It led to the development of a Legislation as Code reusable component in the Lab (currently being used for three life event services and Alphas). The work is widely considered world leading and a significant opportunity for true digital transformation. The MBIE Better for Business team want to co-lead some work with the Lab around the opportunities, including the establishment of an informal cross sector user group to support and share insights across the research, policy/legislative and implementation work streams being driven by different entities across New Zealand, and a cross jurisdiction demonstrator is considered a priority by the D7 to explore how legislation/rules as code could improve international user experiences. The team have taken steps to apply the Intergenerational Wellness Framework as well as a Māori values framework over the top of work done in and with the Lab, to ensure an alignment with greater social and economic outcomes for New Zealand. The D7 Operational Thematic Group has met every month since February to discuss topics ranging from reusable components, getting value from data, emerging technologies, proactive services, open source. Where topics crossed over into other thematic groups, they were handed over (life events and health in particular). Legislation as code has been a topic of particular interest, including a request to do a short prototype of legislation as code in collaboration with other D7 members to demonstrate in November at the next D7 Summit. New digs! The Lab team moved venues twice in 6 months, and did not lose much productivity due to largely working on cloud based tools and to being quite agile and resilient in our work and culture. The SI Lab team contributed to various papers and reports including the AI Forum Report, various open, digital and inclusion government papers and blueprints, international research on innovation and digital government, and was invited to present to Canada, Australia, Singapore, Philippines, Estonia and Taiwan amongst other countries to share and learn. Upon realising the critical role the Citizen Advice Bureau play for service delivery to over 400,000 New Zealanders each year, the Lab worked with CAB to explore their user needs (anonymously of course, to protect client confidentiality). This provided a better understanding of the need to include trusted third parties in the channel strategy for government services and digital transformation. The concept of reusable components was proven through the delivery of functionality for SmartStart and the Rates Rebates Alpha. Financial Help (SmartStart) was based on the entitlements engine (legislation as code) which was also used for the Rates Rebates Alpha. Services near Me (SmartStart) was based on the services register (Family Services Directory made API enabled) which was also used for the Community Services Card demonstrator. Both reusable components are also being used by non government organisations for testing and the SmartStart infrastructure has also been open sourced for reuse. Below are a series of events run by or with the Lab team: We run monthly Emerging Tech workshops/showcases to help agencies keep abreast of new developments: The first event explored emerging tech and social trends, with special guests from the US Government Services Agency Emerging Tech lead, Justin Herman as well as Dr Rebecca Rumbul from MySociety Measurement in government and service delivery, we had 60 people RSVP. VR and AR (mixed reality technologies), we had 100 people RSVP. APIs for service delivery, we had 70 people RSVP. AI and what feeds it had 100 people RSVP. The Lab ran two Legislative Barriers for Service Delivery workshops resulting in a report that is being championed by the PCO. We supported a Better Rules Hack which tested the concept of legislation as code with the community, with public servants also coming to learn and develop skills in this space (40 people attended Wellington and 40 in Tauranga) The Lab team supported an Optimistic Futures event with InternetNZ and Victoria University exploring 50 year futures across 10 sectors and domains, and followed it up with a “Transitioning to an Optimistic Future” workshop in Techweek to explore how to get there, along with other TechWeek 2018 events. We facilitated and supported a Digital Service Standard Workshop focused on integration of a Māori worldview We ran a Rapid Prototyping for Virtual Reality workshop for industry and community, leading to a pipeline of opportunities around applying VR/AR and game design methods to service design and delivery in government. Report close The Lab has had a good year moving through startup phase to a small scale operational team that can support agencies in the design and development of better public services. An exceptional and highly skilled team has been established around the key goal of improving government services for New Zealanders, enabling systemic transformation of the public sector through collaboration and the application of design and development best practices with a whole of system, user journey and life event based lens. The team have operated under great uncertainty but have delivered above and beyond expectations to prove the value of such a cross agency function as an enabler of genuine service innovation. In June 2018 the Service Innovation Working Group (SIWG, the DCE level governance group) approved a $5.79m budget bid for the Service Innovation work program (including $2m for SmartStart and End of Life services), which would enable an acceleration of the life event based services development in the ambitious work program, which was also signed off by SIWG. Q1 2018 (July - Sept) will see the delivery of more design and delivery work, though it must be noted that the Service Innovation Lab team were unable to access the funding to expand capacity for accelerated delivery until August 2018, thus starting the 2018-19 financial year a little slowly. The gap between approvals and access to funding is a critical risk to progress on the agenda and must be minimised for future years. The work and the way of working (openly) generates a continuous pipeline of opportunities which will be presented to SIRG each meeting for discussion and prioritisation, where the opportunities align with and complement the work program as agreed. As a final word, I want to thank Karl, Darryl and the SIRG and SIWG participants for all their leadership and support. Thank you to all the agencies and Council staff who have worked so collaboratively with an open heart and mind. Thank you to all the companies, organisations & specialists who have shared in the journey, we look forward to working more with industry and non profit partners! A big thank you to the broader Service Innovation team who have provided support, secretariat, expertise and all the work needed to protect an innovation lab from the machinations of government :) Finally, my greatest thanks to all the special, talented, passionate and committed members of the Service Innovation Lab team. You are all exceptional in the work you do and your contributions have made a difference far beyond the scope of what any of us could have imagined. I look forward to seeing our efforts continue to transform, challenge, enable, empower and influence the system around us to truly be what our communities need."},{"title":"Transitioning to an Optimistic Futures Workshop - 18 May 2018","url":"/2018/08/01/Exploring-Optimistic-Futures-Workshop/","tags":["lessons learned","open source"],"body":"Led by Matthew MacCallum and Ben Briggs, Service Innovation Lab The following is content generated in the Transitioning to an Optimistic Future event held as part of Tech Week 2018. Duration 3 hours. Overview The event was designed to build on the concepts and discussions had as part of the Digital Seven Nations and Optimistic Futures Event. In particular we wanted to focus on the human aspect of transition and what would be required of New Zealanders in the future. The topics of discussion were chosen as they we all universally understood human features and common daily activities. This created a level foundation to debate from as opposed to getting caught up in complex technologies and paradigms that could distract and exclude. The role of technology was tightly framed as an enabler and second to behaviour, attributes and activity. Event Description: Building on the Optimistic Futures event held earlier in the year, in this workshop we will explore what’s required for New Zealand/Aotearoa to transition to a better future, moving from an 18th century to a 21st century society. This includes considering: the role of government the role of technology what foundations are needed to support society what role everyone would play in an optimistic future Brought to you by Victoria University of Wellington, InternetNZ and the Service Innovation Lab. This event is part of the Techweek series on Building Government’s Digital Service Innovation Capability. The room was divided into 4 large groups for discussion and exploration. Group share and reflection At the end of the day there was a group share and reflection which had the following insights. The initial discussion was not about the tech, it was about the people Of interest – dealing with someone’s intellect after death…and how this could benefit society Huge number of changes noticed with the activity – progressing from person’s exercise to societal benefits How will government incentivise the changes we’ve identified (that need to happen for optimistic future)? ** More intuitive change, tapping into the psyche of the people Noted we will share outputs from session plus what is happening at MBIE (digital strategy “speed dating” sessions) Starting off with the values was the right type of exercise J ** Had people think about what we’re trying to achieve/the end goal in mind Next conversations we need to have: ** Some kind of personal commitment – make it concrete ** Co-build a public facing repository of the information What caused most discussion: ** The ethical considerations + having a broader community discussion (beyond government) ** Where will the conversation take place + how do we bring other voices in? Activity One - Qualities to thrive as kiwis in 2070 Participants were asked to brainstorm qualities of an optimistic future in which kiwis could thrive and then chose 5 per group they felt were the most important. Word cloud of the key concepts from the workshop content The qualities identified (to reflect the word cloud above) are below. Qualities reflected in all four groups: Curiosity - (learn improve collaborate) Empathetic Qualities reflected in three groups: Adaptive Collaborative Confident Creative Qualities reflected in two groups: Bi-Cultural Compassionate - (Love, Mercy) Critically engages/thinking Empowered Environmentally aware/responsive Equitable Open Resilient Trust Finally, qualities reflected in one group included; Absentable, Abundance, Active, Agile, Ambitious, Appreciative, Audacity, Authenticity, Aware, Big picture thinker, Capability or automation, Capacity, Caring, Challenging, Considerate, Connected (place, people, history, whakapapa, turangawaewae), Courageous, Decisive, Diversity, Ethical, Explorative, Flexible, Generosity, Good natured, Honest, Hopeful, Hypocracy, Imaginative, Inclusive, Initiative, Innovative, Kind, Leadership, Love of learning, Loving, Maker skills, Mobility, Multicultural, Neighbourly, No structural inequality, Patience, Positive, Proactive, Productive, Proud, Reflect, Resourceful, Respectful, Responsible, Risk tolerant, Savvy, Self awareness, Smart, Social, Supportive, Sustainable, Survival Skills, Tolerant, Truthful, Values Driven, Visionary, Work/life Balance (2) The cumulatirve top 5 prioritised qualities list from each group were (number of groups): Empathy/sympathy/self awareness (3) Diversity (2) Creativity Critical Thinking Love of Learning/Curiosity Maker Skills Curiosity Trust Reflection Decisive Courageous Resilient Sustainable Kind & Inclusive Environmentally Responsible Ethical Resourceful Risk tolerant Full Definitions of prioritised qualities: Group 1 Def Empathy/sympathy/self awareness - understanding yourself, others and the impacts/consequences of your actions Important because: We are seeing the dehumanisation of people in our current systems. Our optimistic future is truly human centred Mātauranga Māori instead of economic outcomes, we measure social and environmental ones We want a trust based society, not blockchain one Rehumanise the workforce Creativity - expression, problem solving, making an intuitive leap, to make an idea tangible. Important because: It will enable us to have a viable empowered future Without creativity there is no progress Forward momentum and flow We can’t understand or express the art of the possible Learned helplessness and inability to envisage better systems Creativity makes people unique Curiosity and love of learning - desire to explore, understand the world around you Important because: In a changing world, a love of learning will enable us to advance and embrace change with joy. Change as an opportunity not a threat The world will only become more complex Love of Learning as a platform for your ability and confidence to respond to complexity Critical thinking - ability to discern truth, deconstruct content to value, truth and facts, ability to contextualise information - natural motivations, values etc Important because: Deception will become grander and more complex (especially technological ability to fabricate falsehood) Value truth over a good story Maker Skills - the skills and perspective that assumes you can form the world around you, you are not bound by the tools you have, you build what you need and are empowered to do so Important because: We have the tech to create anything - enables us to build bespoke solutions for what we need Don’t have to be passive consumers Empowered to be critical creative and make things Group 2 Defs: Trust - don’t fear interactions, know/respect boundaries and rules, vulnerability, it’s reflective/2-way, honesty, accountability - implied or explicit, foundation of the relationship, being treated as a human being Diversity - wanting to scan all options and ways of doing things, sense of self is valued, open ears, allowance for differences, ability to express views, how to channel power through process, inclusion, learning from others, rights, “recognising the power of paradigm”, respect for people, ability to participate, social norms Empathy - do things with people not to people, understanding without appropriation, try to feel what other people feel, empathetic > Sympathetic (empowering > Patronising) Curiosity - opportunity to learn, improve, contribute, at the top of the hierarchy of needs, in the boundaries of what’s acceptable, ethics, different power structures, may be self-disruptive, it’s good but can be dangerous. Reflection - share failures, transparency, look in the mirror, meditative, requires space and time, truth - don’t erase the facts, fits with work/life balance, understanding our past and learning from it, take pause and reflect integrate inputs Group 3 Defs: Courageous - Be brave about change, be willing to be the first to act. Resilient - Internal strength and ability to push through adversity with optimism and adaptability Kind & Inclusive - With compassion and responsibility actively enable and support participation in society and valuing differences Sustainable - Consider long term impact and understand we’re living from finite resources Decisive - To make decisions and act with confidence, with timeliness and being aware of trade offs. Clarity of thought, long term thinking. Being more comfortable with failure. Group 4 Defs: Resourceful - Curiosity, innovative adaptive and critically engaged Ethical - Empathetic, considerate, equitable Risk Tolerant - Confident, positive and patient in response to changing environment Diverse - Open, tolerant, values driven, respectful of difference Environmentally Responsive - Improvement driven, technologically fluent, climate disruption, responsive Important because: Innovate or Die Subjugation aint cool Without progress and the confidence to take risks only stagnation results Acceptance of diversity underpins respect Survival! Empathy - How does it work through technology? It’s a very human characteristic Activity Two - Performing actions today vs 2070 Participants were asked to choose one of the following activities and explore the process both today and in 2070 and how their qualities from Activity One might impact how they are performed. Activities: Start a business Get a health check Grow food - Group 2, Group 3 Visit a friend or family member Campaign for rights/beliefs Prepare a meal Do exercise - Group 4 Shop for a gift A day of high school Have a funeral - Group 1 Travel on holiday Below are the present and future states each group brainstormed. We intentionally looks 50 years out to think about new horizons rather than iterations on the status quo. Have a funeral - Group 1 Now: person dies of incurable disease, old age, car accident their passwords and access dies with them paperwork to formalise death - probate, govt processes obiturary in the newspaper funeral happens, people travel to it body is buried or cremated mind is gone mourning - family remembers them through photos, videos, letters, social media? religious and cultural components 2070: less unexpected deaths, so person has time to manage affairs, more euthanasia, plenned funerals bio tracking knows you’ve died, user-authorised services are notified and person’s wishes enacted - still human gatekeeper funeral - laws prohibiting satellite corpses, energy considered in body removal, homogenised religious/cultural approach? relationship to physical body changes as consciousness is able to be uploaded therapy for mourning An AI likeness lives on The life long learning of the person lives on in IP commons. Can someone else download a consciousness or ideas/knowledge from that person? Grow food - nutrition - Group 2 Now: Plan (space, season, crops, compliance) Prepare (dig, single vs family vs commercial consumption, water requirements, pest control, fencing, composting/supplements) Plants, maintain, harvest and back to planning with some automation employed for larger operations. 2070: Vertical, shared and more diversity in crops and methods Disruption to supply chain Tracability of crop lineage and social responsibility Better ways to measure the value of growing food Reflection, measurements and iteration on resource usage Empathy on food security and sharing Curiosity on food as medicine and eHealth Understanding how our past shapes our food Grow food - nutrition - Group 3 Now: Mix of mass and individual production Organics are popular Community gardens and distribution Highly seasonal - problematic Labour intensive - problematic New plant varieties not keeping up with climate change Inefficiencies - waste distribution Competitive global market R&D is great Environmental threats - pesticides, biodiversity, etc Farming is in our kiwi DNA Site prearation and decision making Resourcing - equipment and people Know your market and integrate with environmental factors Supermarkets dominate 2070 (with qualities): NZ developes best protein DNA DNA of cow - headless carcass with no pain (ethics) grow at home - 3D printing, predictive & inspiring, based on individual needs, land gets back to early state and rich biodiversity open sourcing of food production - sharing DNA code, incentivised social schemes & govt policy with different motives and measurements from today All supported by: decisive, courageous, resilient, sustainable, and kind/inclusive values. Exercise and healthy living - Group 4 Now: decide on exercise find and wear appropriate exercise clothes choose venue plan time find appropriate companions double check motivation book/schedule events transport to and from stretching and exercise review performance procrastinate at any stage 2070: greater access to diverse, affordable and open access options built into daily routine (treadmill desks?), big analytics focus Companions less necessary due to a) corporeal and b) human options Mental health reflection built in (mindfullness) Diary optimisation and automation More bio monitoring to optimise exercise plan according to need Generate power or credits from tasks Activity Three - Roles & Requirements Participants were asked to then reflect on the previous activities and discuss and answer the following questions: What effects could this have at a community or national level e.g. benefits and challenges? Should government play a role? if so what? How could technology enable these? Group 1 - have a funeral National and Community level: Pragmatics sorted control Will of how your ‘mind’ can be used after your death How can you participate in society after you die? E.g. can you vote, give testimony etc. What are your rights How does this effect whakapapa? Does your mind get passed down - whole new oral tradition Can virtual minds aggregate knowledge/take action? E.g. indigenous minds protect against colonialism Role of Government: Does government ‘own’ its citizens minds after death? Can a person choose a different nationality after they die? Protecting a persons rights/privacy after they die How can technology enable: Safeguards - controlling/choosing how your mind can be used/altered - git control not blockchain Death bureaucracy automated Having your own AI avatar as executor Living on virtually after death Group 2 - grow food/nurtrition Effects on Community/Country: Sharing economy Will we be able to “grow” meat? Nutritional Value Based on values = optimistic future = no gap Role of Government: Regulations/framework across/ standards Research - promote/encourage = partnership with academia Local government - info on soil, percentage of public land available to grow food? How can technology enable: Robots Soilchecking Fruit salad trees via grafting Enable traceability Water conservation Meteorological forecasting Nutritional check GMO? More nutritional Harvesting distribution based on need Group 3 - grow food/nutrition Effects on Community/Country: Position NZ as quality and food experts Better use of global resources Our small population means being able to test and identify benefits quickly Better health through personalised food solutions Less ethical dilemma over consuming protein More options for learning about alternatives Equality and no poverty Role of Government: Education on how it works Regulation of ‘programmable’ food Maintain a group of people who are aware of the tech Incentivise communities for uptake How can technology enable: Sharing IP (open source) Benefits: History of being a primary provider Decreasing food scarcity Challenges: Identity crisis Changing mindsets may take a while to get there Socialising change in food production Isolation is possible - too much time with nothing meaningful to do Reliance on technology Group 4 - do exercise Effects on Community/Country: More likely to try different things as potential lower risk Specialisation in work/activities Who will be motivated to fund? Medical insurance, government… Medical /physical/mental health measurement, monitoring and development - more efficiency and comparatives Community contribution = credit generation (?) Early diagnosis Role of Government: Funding Enabling and encouraging activities Exposure to different roles and activities Provides right guidelines to encourage healthier choices + private sector innovation in this area Regulation for ethical implications of data use How can technology enable: Regular open and VR access Regulate or schedule daily routines Monitors detect physical level and give optimal preparations Key themes of the effects on Society Participation in society before and after death Sharing of knowledge and passing down generations Specialised in what we do and offer Key themes Tech: Traceability and control Knowledge sharing Key themes Role of Govt: Encouragement and incentivisation Measure and evaluate Protect privacy"},{"title":"Exploring the Notice of Sale Process","url":"/2018/10/12/Exploring-the-Notice-of-Sale-process/","tags":["lessons learned"],"body":"Authored by: Glen Thurston and Nadia Webster Contents In summary What is the notice of sale and why is it important? Possible solution Next Steps Exploring the Notice of Sale process Exploring opportunities to improve the notice of sale process as part of the life event of ‘selling and buying a property’ A collaboration between: The All of Government Service Innovation Lab Auckland Council Land Information New Zealand Tauranga City Council Wellington City Council Whangarei District Council In summary In August 2018, a collaboration led by the all of government Service Innovation Lab with Auckland Council, Land Information New Zealand (Valuer General), Tauranga City Council, Wellington City Council and Whangarei District Council explored the Notice of Sale (the notice) process as part of the ‘selling and buying a property’ life event. This group believe that there are a range of possible solutions to improve the notice; for the benefit of people selling and buying property, their agents (ie real estate agent, solicitors, conveyancers), Councils and government agencies teams. During August, the group explored: The role of the notice and its importance, Goals for the future of the notice, Pain points and experiences that people and organisations involved with the notice are having, Potential opportunities/solutions for improving the process. The work was completed in three parts, a current state review with the Wellington based group members, a design intensive in Auckland (13-16 August) followed by the write up of the findings of both the review and the design intensive. The goal of this work was to help the group of interested parties identify a path forward to improve the notice process. It helps scope up future design work that would be needed to explore the opportunities in more depth to ascertain their desirability from a user perspective, viability from a business sustainability perspective and feasibility from a technical perspective. The design intensive identified the following next steps that are needed to continue this work: The need for a sponsor(s) to help drive continuing this work. The Lab could lead a discovery with the support of this group to investigate the preferred data based possible solution in more detail to test its viability, feasibility and desirability. The Councils collectively or individually could investigate the other two solutions identified; in the intensive; Improve communication between Councils and Solicitors and data validation flags to help select the correct process to use. What is the notice of sale and why is it important? The Notice of Sale (the notice) acts a conduit of sales and/or property owner information in the property transfer process and its a legal requirement that it must be supplied to a Local Authority1 (ie Councils) as part of the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002. For a Council the notice is typically the first contact they have about the transfer and importantly the new owner of the property. This allows them to update the rating information to send out the rates notice to them. The notice includes valuable sale information where a sale is involved (eg tells them how much the property sold) for which is important for the valuation purposes as it helps give an indication on the valuations for an area. Rates and valuations are linked together and the notice is one of the key inputs into this process. The notice gives more information and data about the property that helps to give a better indication of valuation and therefore the rates to charge. The rating and valuation process (Flow chart showing that Valuation cycle & Local Authority actions feeds into the Setting and billing of rates, then to Property Owner.) In addition to the rating process the notice also acts another way to provide information that the property title has changed too. The notice of sale and its relation to rating and valuation (also see Appendix 1 for the key concepts required under legislation and what triggers a change of ownership, and see Appendix 2 Data Map for what data is collected at each step in the process) (Notice of Sale decision tree. Path 1 - Notice of change of ratepayer and/or their contact details of whole or part of the rating unit; Council finance team accountable fo calculation of rates. This is Audited by DIA; Council valuation team accountable for valuation data being correct. This is audited by LINZ valuer general. They determine structure of data extracts for comparable analysis. Path 2 - Notice of change of title (i.e. creation of a new title and cancellation of existing title); Register of Titles; Valuation Service Providers (VSP). They are accountable for the calculation of valuations. Councils are also required to provde the correct data/information to contirbute to the calculation.) The notice must contain these points: The full name and address of the purchaser or transferee; and in the case of a sale, the sale price. It has to be supplied to the Council within one month after the sale or transfer of a rating unit by the person selling it. Key legislative references are: Sections 31 - 33 and 36 of the Local Government (Ratings) Act 2002 Section 52 of the Rating Valuation Act 1998 There is no prescribed form for the notice or methods to transmit the information to Councils. The notices vary depending on the other information requirements that Councils request or what solicitors typically want to send to support the sale. The QV sales direct online form was originally built around what is mandatory but has been amended over time based on solicitor and council requirements; most notably contact details for new owner. There is also no definition for the term ‘property’ as it’s not a clear concept. From a rating perspective at Councils it’s the title and rating unit. Statistics From the LINZ Rating Valuation Data set, the following table describes the number of sales between 2014 to 2017. Number of Sales 2014-2017 (Table showing the number of sales between 2014 to 2017 with sales totalling to 229,855.) While the majority of property transfers are residential, there are a range of complex sales that are harder to facilitate and process. These include: Farm sales Subdivisions Apartments and unit titles Commercial buildings Earthquake prone buildings Maori leasehold land Leasehold titles Trust and trustee changes Result of river changing boundaries The notice and its importance to NZ Inc The notice directly help contribute to understanding New Zealand’s Financial and Physical Capital as defined in Treasury’s Living Standards Framework (LSF). This framework draws on OECD analysis of wider indicators of wellbeing with the starting point is answering three questions: What are current outcomes? Will these outcomes be sustained or improved? How resilient is the system? The LSF is based on four capitals that organise indicators of sustainable intergenerational Wellbeing and for the notice Financial and Physical Capital is most applicable. This includes: Financial and physical capital includes the buildings, machines and equipment and other conventional investment, including capital spending by government. The financial assets of households provide resilience to unexpected life events and retirement. Housing is a major contributor to current wellbeing and is the highest-valued household asset. How do we link the information contained in the notice and use this with other data sources and use this for measuring the health and resilience of New Zealand properties and therefore contribute to Financial and Physical Capital wellbeing? There is an opportunity to use the notice of sale data linked with the core rating valuation data to provide profiles of the housing stock of New Zealand ie that is we know the owner/occupier vs rentals, type of housing, construction, age, spacial (ie where they are located). What else could the data be mashed up with? What stories could this tell and what it could inform? Open data The notice of sale information is deemed to be ‘open data’ ie it’s data anyone can use and share. It has an open licence, is openly accessible and is both human-readable and machine-readable. To protect the integrity of the property sector the data needs to be made available to aid with transparency and avoid corruption. The Design Intensive The challenge for the Notice of Sale design intensive was to explore what a positive, effective customer experience looks like when based on a real-world life event (see this blog post about the value of life events). The design team sought to understanding the big picture associated with notice of sale and where it fits within the life event of selling and buying a home and together seek to understand the desired outcome from different perspectives and identify indicative opportunities to achieve these outcomes. Representatives from Whangarei District Council, Auckland Council, Tauranga City Council, Wellington City Council, LINZ and the Service Innovation Lab (the lab) were involved as team members involved either before and/or during the three day intensive between 13-15 August. During the intensive we wanted to explore in the design sprint: High level understanding of where the notice of sale fits within the life event of selling and buying a property Generate a collective understanding of the goals we seek for notice of sale. Reveal the pain-points, opportunities and constraints for the customer, agents, third parties and government agencies teams and understand what their motivations are. Reveal service bottlenecks, dead ends and successful interactions Explore any possible outcomes that could be developed that ease the pain-points Explore if there is an opportunity for reusable components to be created During the three days of the intensive we covered: Day 1: Gather – Outline the complex problem, goals sought, audiences involved and their motivations Day 2: Define – Assess problems, opportunities and constraints, themes Day 3: Ideate / Visualize – Scenarios for our audiences and how we might make change This is based on the following logic mapping flow model2(as shown below) developed by Dr Hazel Bradshaw from the Service Innovation Lab: (Logic Mapping Flow diagram. Starts with Complex Problem; Overarching Goal; Audience Types; Motivation(Intrinsic); Motivation (Extrinsic); Problem/Pain Points; Constraints; Emerging Concepts; and lastly IDEATE.) The complex problem Buying and selling a property is complicated transaction, it requires information to be exchanged between a number of parties and if errors are made it has consequences for property ratings and valuations. This can lead to stress and have financial implications for the parties particularly the property buyer. The team considered this complex problem and were asked to consider the life event in the context of the notice of sale. Here are the themes the team identified: Target theme - Automation The theme selected as a focus point was Automation. The team would like to automate as much of the current manual process as possible to improve the quality of submissions. They’d like to get rid of the term “notice of sale” from their vocabulary to allow time to focus on more important or higher value interactions with ratepayers and clients. They’s like to to see data entered once and transmitted electronically to all the stakeholders involved in the process (preferably from a single place). It was noted that automation should not be at the expense of verification, accuracy and completion. Other themes in order of importance to the team Single source of truth. There is no current single source of authoritative data for the notice of sale that anyone can draw from eg no one reference number that follows a ownership transfer for parties to use. Team were quite fixed on this as a solution. Data quality. This includes accuracy and completeness. This involves changes in ownership that were not notified to the council or were lost somehow plus the accuracy of the received notices and its input into multiple systems. The discussion also revealed that there is also a need for more information that is needed to complete tasks that is not in the mandated information that must be sent. Eg contact details, postal addresses. The consequences of data quality include the number of manual checks and validation points throughout the process. Most systems also cater for happy day scenarios too. Timeliness. The team advised they need the notice information to be supplied as soon as possible to allow more value add tasks to be completed eg audit. Improving council experience. Because the notice is a a major part of the councils rates and valuation teams business, it takes up a large chunk of their time and they’d love to streamline the work for the sake of accuracy, auditing and sanity. Improved customer experience. The team are passionate about making life better and easier for our customers. From a solicitor perspective it’s about the desire to improve the process for the profession and their clients. Hopefully improvements will lead to an increase in trust between all parties. Data transmission. The notice needs to be sent to many parties, how could this be made easier? How do we make it more user friendly for solicitors to provide information? Goal setting - What are the end goals The team considered the goals associated with the complex problem statement - why is a goal important for this work? what does it look like? These end goals were identified for the notice both from a higher level and a specific goal to focus on for this design intensive. The higher level goals were: Will improve the accuracy of sales and owner information that will ultimately result in better rating valuations and revaluations. Consistent, complete information that drives decision making and innovation - one source of truth for all market participants eg buyers and sellers, real estate agents, councils, central government. Better data helps contribute to better economic outcomes especially considering how property is a big driver in NZ economic success. Helps improve the quality of house and property owners interactions with Council - often their first contact is a compliant due to an error with the rates and valuations. Improved service for people involved in sales and transfers. The goal selected for the intensive was Data Quality - this is needed for the rating and valuation tasks. This includes missing sales, accuracy of the data received and needing more information beyond the current notice rules to complete tasks. It was recognised that to help with the theme of Automation data quality will be a key enabler. From this there were some sub goals: Efficiency of process for everyone to free up people up to do higher value things/work Trust in data and process integrity to meet compliance requirements and ensure confidence for property owners. Related themes to data quality (in order of importance) were accuracy and completeness of the notice, verified data within the notice and ability for data sources to be linked. Other themes were improving the process within Councils, efficiency of process for all parties by creating less touch points and making compliance with the process easier. It was noted that data quality would help mitigate the problems people encounter that are represented in the other themes. Audience Mapping The primary audience for the goals and theme is Council teams plus the agents (solicitor / conveyancer) who facilitates the notice for property buyers and sellers. Their relationship is key to the notice process being completed and sent to Council but also how issues are identified and resolved together. There is also a difference in expectations between the two regarding the amount of data that needs to be supplied to ensure that the new owner of property is correctly identified and billed the right amount of rates. Council teams included: customer data coordinators, customer services staff, digital capture, revenue, mailroom, credit control. For the agents this also extends to their professional bodies, individual practices, legal executives and secretaries, juniors. The secondary audience is LINZ most notably the OVR, Valuation Service Providers and third party utilities that directly need the NoS eg Watercare. These groups are essential for the valuation of properties and the notice is seen as the “life blood” of rating valuation and “without it we have nothing”. Customers were considered to be the the old and new owners of the property, third parties who consume the data, ratepayers, real estate agents, government agencies who consume the data, software developers, office of auditor general. These groups of customers are impacted by the notice especially if there is issues with the data quality for a property but for the most part they will not be directly affected. Motivation Mapping - Intrinsic and extrinsic (Table showing the Intrinsic & Extrinsic motivations for Primary audiences (Councils & Solicitors) and Secondary audiences.) Problems the audiences are having To consider the problems the various audiences are having the team were asked to map out the journeys for the solicitors and council teams. Prior to the intensive, a service blueprint describing the journey from presale triggers to post-sale settlement was created and this was used by the team as a reference for their maps. (Flow diagram of the Notice of Sale Process. Pre-Sale; Sale & Purchase agreement signed; Unconditional; Settlement (can be up to 6 months before Settlement); & Post-settlement.) Solicitor journey map (Post-it notes for Journey Map. Votes on Education/Action Points; & Unreliable Data.) (Post-it notes for Journey Map. Votes on Incorrect or Missing Data; Human Error; & Duplicating Information.) Council journey map (Post-it notes for Journey Map. Top votes on Manual processing/checking including multiple handling of the notice.) The journey maps revealed a range of pain points. The pain point themes were: Education and knowledge at key action points Unreliable data Problem themes Duplication of information Human error Incorrect or missing data The notice is not received Manual processing/checking including multiple handling of the notice Difficult to find and match data Churn - checking, comms, rework These selected themes were turned into problem statements using the following format: As a [audience type] the problem I (or we) have is [pain point]. This impacts my ability to [task or outcome the audience is trying to solve]. The problem statements were consider and themed to identify common elements with the top three themes consolidated into these problem statements: Problem statement one - accurate and complete information As a solicitor, I have a problem with providing accurate and complete information to councils about the property being sold, transferred or changed eg its location address and the Council or Territorial Local Authority and about the property owner (eg their name and contact details incl their postal address, email, mobile number). This impacts: my ability to meet my client needs, to do a good job and ensure my compliance with the rules. Council’s ability to efficiently process changes to property data, rating database and comply with rules Council’s ability to contact property owners Council workers ability to do a good job, deliver a good service to ratepayers and improve the Council’s reputation. For each problem statement the team considered if there are any constraints associated with it and how hard it might be to resolve them: (Table matching Ability to resolve a constraint (Easy; Medium; Hard) with Constraints.) Problem statement two - manual processing As a Council administrator, me and my team leaders have a problem with the large amount of manual processing to complete the input of the notice of sale. This impacts our ability to: approach this task with enthusiasm and makes my job boring save money for ratepayers that could be better spent on things in my community work well with solicitors, who through our processing errors will have difficulties with their clients (Table matching Ability to resolve a constraint (Easy; Medium; Hard) with Constraints.) Problem statement three - triggers for notice of sale As a Solicitor the problem I have is that I don’t know all the triggers for the Notice of Sale and its importance to rates and valuations. This impacts my ability to: meet my clients needs work with councils and their need for information for rates and valuations, payments and refunds and debt collection. (Table matching Ability to resolve a constraint (Easy; Medium; Hard) with Constraints.) The team believe that if these problems were fixed then it could resolve many of the problems described in the other themes. These other themes that resulted from the creation of the problem statements were data input and matching, manual processing and validation, not sending or receiving the notice, the impacts of errors and the impacts to the value of the team and individuals within it. Scenario and storyboard building - exploring problems and solutions To explore problems and solutions for these scenario and storyboard techniques were used. The team created a scenario that addresses the audience problem, meets the a clear goal and works within the constraints. A scenario should have an audience, a goal, a set of constraints and a beginning, middle and an end. These were themed and storyboards were created based on the prioritised scenarios. Each person shared their storyboards and then team was separated into groups who took the scenarios, identified their common elements and collaborated to create a refined storyboard. (Team collaborated to create a refined storyboard from the common elements of the scenarios.) Problem statement one - accurate and complete information A range of scenarios were created and many had similar themes. Here are the priorised themes las decided by the group: Property transfer in a single portal - data validated against authoritative datasets. Accurate ratepayer contact information - education of ratepayers Correct Correct or territorial local authority selected - against an authoritative dataset Tied with no votes: Councils validate their databases against authoritative datasets, solicitors validates data against authoritative sources, accurate ratepayer contact information - verified against authoritative datasets. Here is the storyboards for the property transfer in a single portal. (Storyboard for the Property Transfer made up of post-it notes.) This storyboard was ultimately the one selected to explore further during the rest of the design intensive. Problem statement two - manual processing A range of scenarios were created but they had a similar theme - property transfer in a single portal. Here is the storyboards for the property transfer in a single portal. For the refined storyboard because of the similarity with those created in statement one, they should be combined. Problem statement three - triggers for notice of sale There were two themes that were tied in priority: Improve communication between Councils and Solicitors - spending time together Rules and data validation flags to help select the correct process to use. Here are the refined storyboards. The team believed that these ideas could be something that could be done within each Council and trialling the approach with local law firms and conveyancers. Improve communication between Council and Solicitors - ‘spending time together’ Rules and data validation flags to help select the correct process to use. Possible solution The idea behind this possible future state is that much of the data required to action what is currently called the ‘Notice of Sale’ process is captured within the Sales and Purchase Agreement or through the Transfer Instrument (see Appendix 2 Data Map for what data is collected at each step in the process). There are different triggers for this process (see the triggers in Appendix 1), which is actually the process of changing the ownership of a rating unit. Rather than expecting each person in the process chain to perform manual data entry then we could imagine a process where the data is kept as electronic data and systematically pushed through the required states of a workflow. Ideally this would satisfy the legislative requirements (see Appendix 1 for the key concepts required under legislation) while achieving the goal of improved data quality and improved trust in the process. (Flow diagram describing the Change of Ownership of a Rating Unit - Future State version 0.2) This future state needs deeper investigation to determine its desirability, viability and feasibility, and would necessarily involve a slow transition, including improving data quality within the various databases over time. A Minimum Viable Product might involve manual data entry from the Sales and Purchase Agreement into a data integration tool, or an upload of a data extract from a smart form version of the agreement. Next Steps The group discussed the need for a sponsor(s) to help drive continuing this work. It was agreed that the sponsor could be a person or group of people but they should be at be at an executive leadership level eg a CFO. The group of councils involved with this exploration will need to work together to identify a sponsor(s) and brief them on this work and its importance. Depending on the priorities for the 2018/19 Service Innovation Lab work programme, the Lab could lead a discovery with the support of this group to investigate the possible solution in more detail to test its viability, feasibility and desirability. The Councils collectively or individually could investigate the other two opportunities identified in the intensive; Improve communication between Councils and Solicitors - spending time together and Rules and data validation flags to help select the correct process to use. The team believed that these ideas could be something that could be done within each Council and trialling the approach with local law firms and conveyancers. This is being currently being explored further collective team. Appendix 1 : Notice of Sale Context Diagram This diagram maps out the relevant concepts in the legislation relating to Notice of Sale to help with understanding the current legislative requirements. To read the diagram follow the arrows, i.e Ratepayer (Owner and/or Lessee) owns or occupies Rating Unit; Rating Unit created, maintained and held in District Valuation Roll. (Diagram of concepts in leglislation relating to the Notice of Sale process.) Triggers for notice of change of ownership of a rating unit Although commonly referred to as a “notice of sale”, that’s actually a bit of a misnomer as it not just sales that trigger the need for a notice. Broadly speaking, there are four triggers: If an owner sells or otherwise transfers a rating unit or any part of a rating unit (section 31(1) Local Government (Rating) Act 2002); If a person becomes the owner of a rating unit by operation of law (section 31(3) Local Government (Rating) Act 2002); Registration of a change of name of a rating unit (section 36 Local Government (Rating) Act 2002); and Transfer, assignment, surrender or termination of lease (sections 32 and 33 of the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002). In the case of a sale of a rating unit, Section 31 of the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002 provides that a vendor or, if the vendor has an agent, the vendor’s agent must, within one month of the effective date of sale or transfer, provide the relevant local authority with: the full name and address of the purchaser; and in the case of a sale, the sale price. The legislation does not mandate the form in which the notice is provided. Additionally, there is no definition of “sale price”. In all other cases, the transferor (former owner) must notify Council of the change in owner of the rating unit. Again, the legislation does not mandate the form in which the notice is provided. So which instruments trigger the need for a Notice? The sale of a property which results in the registration of a transfer instrument is the most obvious trigger for a Notice, but it’s far from the only one. Other common transactions which trigger need for a Notice include: Dealing with an estate resulting in registration of a Transmission (instrument quick code TSM) A mortgagee sale resulting in registration of a Transfer in exercise of Power of Sale (instrument quick code TPS); Registration of a Joint Family Home application (instrument quick code JFH); and A change of name of an owner (due to marriage or a company changing its name) (instrument quick code CN). Additionally, there are a number of less common transactions that could trigger need for a Notice – some of which are incredibly rear. For example: Transferring assets on the winding up of an Incorporated Society resulting in registration of an application under section 27 of the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 (instrument quick code A27); An application for accretion as a result of changing river boundaries (instrument quick code ACC); An application under section 99A of the Land Transfer Act 1952 to record a statutory vesting (instrument quick code A99A); and An application to transfer land as a result of the Health Sector (Transfers) Act 1993 (instrument quick code A9).

The subsidy is delivered by Local Councils and is administered by Central Government (specifically the Department of Internal Affairs - DIA). The entitlement value is calculated by the cost of the rates, applicants income, and number of dependants. The maximum subsidy amount is reviewed yearly. The Service Innovation Working Group (SIWG) within the Digital Government Partnership supported by the GCDO, prioritised and approved an initiative to explore the design and delivery of a proactive service with the goal of being to create an automated service. Rates Rebates was identified as a service for this initiative based on research for the becoming a senior life event. This collaborative initiative was between DIA as the lead agency (ie business owner) and Local Authorities (ie Councils) supported by the Service Innovation Lab (the Lab) in the delivery of the work through the Discovery and Alpha phases. Through a phase of work called a ‘discovery’ the Rates Rebates service was mapped and reviewed, internal and external stakeholders were interviewed, and potential methods of service delivery were explored. The discovery revealed many opportunities at the system level to improve the experience for both the people applying for their entitlement and people delivering the service. A minimum viable product (MVP) was designed and developed between March—May 2018 and an online service for rebate applications was trialled in Tauranga from 21 May—30 September 2018 with Tauranga City Council. This phase of work was called an ‘alpha’. The alpha was focused on testing system changes. Tauranga City Council, Auckland Council was involved with assisting with the design and test of the alpha and numerous councils have been watching progress closely. Both the discovery and the alpha identified that there is desirability to progress the alpha service to full production from both an applicant and local councils perspective and the Lab is currently supporting DIA to explore how to transition the alpha to a Beta (ie first live production). This report incompasses all the work the collaborative team (ie DIA, local authorities and the Lab) has been involved with to date with Rates Rebates. It contains background about the Rates Rebates scheme, insights found during both the discovery and alpha, a description about the recent alpha work and the discovery that underpinned the work. Combined, this provides a complete picture of how we (ie the collaborative team) did the work, what we learned and our recommendations for making rates rebate an automated service that could could form part an integrated service for specific life events (eg Becoming a Senior, Needing Financial Assistance). Background Why was this brought to the Service Innovation Lab The Rates Rebates entitlement was identified as a proactive entitlement for the Service Innovation Lab to explore by the Service Innovation Working Group. Because of the large number of applicants who are Superannuitants, this is also a service that is considered to play a part in the “Becoming a Senior” life event. Who has been involved? Discovery Phase Department of Internal Affairs, Tauranga City Council, Auckland Council, Wellington City Council, Ministry of Social Development, Inland Revenue, Assurity, Service Innovation Lab. Alpha Phase Tauranga City Council, Department of Internal Affairs, Auckland Council, Service Innovation Lab, The entitlement in numbers In the 2016/2017 rating year 97,947 rebates were granted, of those 80,486 were the full $610. The maximum subsidy amount is reviewed yearly - for 2016/17 the maximum was $610. In 2017/18 the maximum is $620. In 2018/19 its $630. The trend shows the number of rebates granted each year going down. This is a well known trend and is mostly due to the income threshold not keeping in pace with the rise in superannuation payments year to year, leading to those on the couples super especially, gradually dropping out of eligibility. Other factors include housing affordability and lowering home ownership rates - Appendix Two1 contains more information on this trend and causal factors. There is not enough data available at this time for us to know: How many apply and are rejected due to inconsistent implementation processes across council How many people are eligible across Aotearoa New Zealand How many know their eligibility or that the entitlement exists, and How many choose to apply or not. Rating year Maximum rebate Rebates granted Value (inc GST) Average Rebate Full (maximum) rebates granted Average rebate granted < maximum 2010-11 $570 112,181 $59,131,590 $527.11 91,941 $332.27 2011-12 $580 115,187 $62,340,668 $541.21 95,988 $347.29 2012-13 $590 111,021 $60,231,307 $542.52 90,857 $328.59 2013-14 $595 106,416 $58,086,259 $545.84 87,209 $322.64 2014-15 $605 104,410 $58,092,996 $556.39 86,047 $328.63 2015-16 $610 102,208 $57,102,376 $558.69 83,737 $326.07 2016-17 $610 97,947 $54,655,977 $570.23 80,486 $318.40 2017-18 $620 97,609 $55,496,610 $568.56 80,810 $321.00 Rebate amendment In February 2018 the Rates Rebate Amendment Act 2018 was passed that grants those who live in retirement villages eligibility to receive Rates Rebates, expanding the number of eligible by approximately 25,000. Data from last year suggests 36,618 people currently live in retirement villages, these are comprised of 28,168 units. Some of these units were already eligible to apply under the old legislation if they were rated separately and in the name of the resident. We don’t have numbers for this but it’s a minority of units, most units are newly covered by the recent legislation. High level estimate of units newly eligible to apply is around 25,000. The number actually eligible to receive a rebate will be much lower due to income levels and value of rates. For example, most couples aren’t eligible as the couples superannuation income, together with having relatively low rates precludes a lot of them. Our key stakeholders Ratepayers Those eligible for a rebate are people who own and live in their home with an income level below a formula determined by their rates. Local Government Application forms are accepted by Local Government, who do initial processing of the entitlement and apply it to applicants residential property rating accounts. Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) DIA administer the rebate, are responsible for the paper forms, which they deliver to councils, and are responsible for the payments of rebates to be made to local councils. Pain points for applicants and system During the discovery and the alpha phases we explored all aspects of the rates rebate experience from the perspectives of the users or applicants who apply for their entitlement and the people who are involved in the system of facilitating, checking and approving the applications. Applicants The complexity of application creates a poor customer experience Lack of awareness of rebate entitlement for potential applicants and in social security support systems Citizen time The current system is estimated to cost $1m in citizen time alone2. Issues affecting mobility and access Due to many applicants being over 65 and/or with disabilities, the impact of the requirement of Statutory Declaration in front of a witness impacts accessibility for the core customer group. System The process is very manual and involves costly double handling. Applicants must fill in the same information and apply every year even when their information does not change. Preventable cost of implementation to councils and wait times for payments back to councils from DIA Prescriptive legislation preventing an end-to-end digital experience The discovery In​ ​September​ 2017 ​the ​team​ ​kicked​ ​off​ ​a​ ​three-week​ ​discovery​ ​sprint,​ ​exploring​ ​how​ ​subsidies​ ​are provided​ ​to​ ​New​ ​Zealanders​ ​and​ ​what​ ​ ​that​ ​could look​ ​like​ ​in​ ​the​ ​future,​ ​with​ ​a​ ​focus​ ​on​ ​Rates Rebates.​ ​Rates​ ​Rebates​ ​are​ ​an​ ​entitlement​ ​that​ ​has​ ​been​ ​identified​ ​as​ ​a​ ​key​ ​pain​ ​point​ ​for​ ​applicants (low-income​ ​property​ ​owners​ ​for​ ​primary​ ​residences),​ ​as​ ​well​ ​as​ ​for​ ​Local​ ​and​ ​Central​ ​Government. The discovery sprint included service designers, user researchers and subject matter experts from the Department of Internal Affairs (the Service Innovation team as well as the Rates Rebates team), Auckland Council, Tauranga Council, Wellington Council, the Ministry for Social Development and the Inland Revenue Department with support from Assurity. Week One - Kick off Focus points The team identified the following focus points for the three week sprint. Understand​ ​and​ ​Complement​ - Previous Rates Rebates insights focused on the process from an applicant perspective, our team will collect and analyse insight from multiple perspectives including Central and Local Government agencies. We are also looking for additional applicant types that have not been spoken to before and understand the size and demographics of the eligibility groups. Local​ ​and​ ​Global​ ​Picture​ - We are exploring the local and global community and identifying similar concepts, prototypes and entitlement models that we can factor into our concept development. Data​ ​Path​ - Exploring the data path of the process, data ownership, authority and declaration and what this could mean for implementation of any automated concepts. Thinking​ ​Big/Parallel​ ​Value​ - How could this be applied across all of government services. Week Two - Customer research and journey mapping Service blueprint Service Map The Rates Rebates Process touches many agencies. We mapped the journey to see touch points for rebates customers, front stage (agency work visible to the rebate customer), and backstage (agency work not visible to the rebate customer). It showed a very complex picture with a lot of pain across users, Councils and Central government agencies. Considering this entitlement is a maximum of $610 per year, it requires a lot of cost and time from all participants in the process to administer. To view the journey in more detail, please use this link: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1G3cs66o7u-xwJWr2FT46cd5UivJ-HojpcS3I-Q5bSOY/edit?usp=sharing Personas We created the following personas based on the customer groups identified to compliment the personas made in the previous discovery work. Working mother Hannah lives in Southland, looking after her three kids and doing some freelance work in her spare time. She is very capable, but going into town can be a bother – she borrows a car from her neighbour and it’s not always available. Because she lives rurally, she likes to do more things online. She’s short on time and money is always tight. She has found out about the Rates Rebates and wants to get it – but she’s also short on time and not sure if the bother is worth it. Superannuant Jennifer is a retiree living in a block of flats in Wellington city. She doesn’t drive anymore, but manages to get around fine on public transport. She thinks of herself as pretty independent, but sometimes she needs to help with her finances and paperwork – she’s not as good at reading the fine print anymore.

When there is a delay, it’s a real issue. He has lots of interaction with government to claim various benefits and he is comfortable with doing things online - but he doesn’t have his own computer. Week 3 - Concept development and testing We tested 3 concepts, hypothetical ways the process of rebates might work, based on data sharing between agencies, to help make the process easier and efficient. We tested the concepts with those we interviewed to find out their thoughts and opinions. We spoke to 17 ratepayers that covered different demographics to map their experience and pain points. A large portion of them were women and retired, building on previous research from Internal Affairs. Option 1 - Assisted automation opt-in There were varied reactions to this option. Some said they saw issues with it being online, mentioning they know a lot of people in their circles who get rebates and do not have computers or feel comfortable using them. Others liked this but often said they preferred option 3 after they had seen all options. Some suggested that they liked the idea of the service being provided by phone, and suggested that there may be a way for them to make a verbal declaration in place of Statutory Declaration. Option 2 - Automatically apply rebate This option was usually popular, until option 3 was shown and then they decided that this was something they did not actually want. As they were unsure what this would mean if the information was wrong or felt uncomfortable for the govt to be talking about them and deciding things without their knowledge. Many felt that this option was a bit “big brother.” Option 3 - Auto populate data Option 3 was the most popular. People were usually most comfortable with this option as they felt that it still let them be in control, but also made the complex process less work for them. Some felt uncomfortable about their data being shared without their permission and knowledge, and didn’t like the idea of the government ‘talking about me’ as they did not trust the government completely. Many users had the attitude of ‘they already do this/know this information anyway’. The Alpha The Future of the Rates Rebates Service In the Discovery phase there were a number of opportunities identified for service improvement. We also identified barriers from the prescriptive legislation, an Act written in 1973, that impacts what is possible for digital service delivery in 2018. Of the three concepts tested, based on data sharing between agencies to help make the process easier and efficient, option 3 (auto-populate data) was the most popular. People were most comfortable with this option as they felt that it still let them have control, while also making the complex process less work. There are some issues with the legislation around the witnessing of forms, this could prove to be a barrier to this option being easily implemented. Taking these findings we were able to set a goal of what would be possible to achieve for a minimum viable product (MVP), that would support a better Rates Rebates service to be brought into the Alpha stage of testing. This Alpha service has been designed to make it easier for people to identify their eligibility and then apply for the rebate with less effort and stress. It was also designed to simplify service delivery for the council from the current very manual and paper heavy process to a simple, faster and digital service. In the Discovery, the collaborative team tested concepts with ratepayers showing different levels of proactive delivery. The majority of those we spoke to preferred the concept that had some proactive delivery, but had a process of consenting, to ensure that they retained control of the situation, rather than having the rebate automatically applied. This was an important factor in an MVP design, moving into the Alpha stage, for Rates Rebates. As it doesn’t assume a fully proactive delivery in order to meet user expectations of maintaining control throughout the process. We knew that we wanted to improve the service for people, and some constraints from the Rates Rebate Act meant we weren’t able to completely flip the process on its head. The Rates Rebate Act requires the applicant to submit a form, which is then signed and witnessed by an authorised person, usually a service centre staff member at the council when an application is submitted, similar to a statutory declaration. With this knowledge, and knowledge of digital best practice, we were able to set our goals for an MVP. We assembled a team of subject matter experts from the initial discovery team, and brought on developers to help make this digital service a reality. This includes Auckland Council, Tauranga City Council, Department of Internal Affairs, supported by the Service Innovation Lab team. Criteria for alpha to test - our scope Both Councils clearly articulated the need to address the signature/witness legislative barrier to enable a fully digital streamlined service and this has been addressed by DIA Legal advice. Through discussion, the Council then outlined the following specific areas where the proposed Alpha could create immediate value which would be used as success criteria for Alpha and beyond: An increase in uptake of the rebate and decreased time, effort and stress for users that use Alpha. A proportional drop in the refused applications, and we can measure web analytics of how many users roughly started the process and how many applications were completed. If Alpha involves only digital forms, then there would be a decrease in time and cost of processing payment from DIA, however, if the Alpha involves both paper and digital, this success criteria is not relevant to Alpha. Moving to a digital signature of a digital form, even if done in person, should dramatically reduce the resources and courier costs in administering this rebate for Councils, and should reduce effort for DIA. Through user research we will test current state against Alpha and should see an improved satisfaction level from ratepayers who use the services. Adding the collection of email address within the service would improve the ability to digitally deliver other services for Council. Additional success criteria after Alpha (would require integration with Tauranga City Council systems once Alpha proves successful) To reduce the manual processes for helpdesk filling in and doing data entry of the application forms should improve the speed of delivery at help desk, creating a small improvement both in the users experience and in help desk productivity. By simplifying and digitising the process, we hope to see an improvement in the turnaround time of batches sent to DIA and faster payments made to Council. Other desirable components for project to investigate Encourage consistency of messaging across councils and agencies for Rates Rebates. Help address user perceptions, that ‘the entitlement is being made purposely hard to prevent people getting it’, by making it easier to find, assess and apply for. Further research - diving deeper We dived even deeper into understanding the service delivery and what is possible. By examining legislation, technology systems used to run the current service, and modes of delivery we created detailed service blueprints of the current and future states, testing them against each other and our goals for the service improvement. We looked into how data was being submitted by ratepayers in their paper applications, and what forms this data took when digitised, transported, and processed. We looked over the form and worked on how the language could be improved for plain English, and how form fields could be made easier to complete. For example, when asking an applicant’s income, we could provide an option to press a button to state that they are receiving NZ Superannuation, rather than asking them what dollar amount that is, as we already know the figure limits for superannuation. Appendix One contains service blueprints that describe how the current service works, the alpha used in the Tauranga pilot and a potential future state of a fully automated proactive service future state. How the alpha works - user interface design Making it easy To make it easy we built a web application (web app) for the ratepayer applicants to use as the basis of the alpha. Applicants can learn if they were eligible for a Rates Rebate in the current year by entering their address. We created a widget where the applicant only types their address, which is auto-completed for them, and their Rates appear - it uses publicly available data which we obtained in collaboration with the Tauranga City Council. Once the applicant enters their income and number of dependants, they get an indication of their Rates Rebate. If they provide accurate information, they will get an accurate calculation - it’s all in one place, the user interface design guides people through the process giving them the information needed to help them make a decision whether its worthwhile for them to apply or not. If the applicant calculated they are eligible and chooses to apply, they are then presented with more information to ensure they understand the definitions of income and dependants. We were able to eliminate the need for paper in this process. Once an application is submitted online, the applicant then must visit the Tauranga City Council service centre, where they then make their statutory declaration on a touchscreen iPad using a stylus. The signature is saved and can be sent digitally to DIA. We could not avoid asking the applicant to travel to a city council service centre, because the legislation requires a witnessed declaration. The web application frontend was built in ReactJS, with a jsonapi.org server created with JSONAPI Suite on Ruby on Rails. Signatures were captured using “signature_pad” npm module. The web app was built in five weeks. All components used were open source, and available on github.com for other agencies to use. Eligibility calculator Our research told us people applying for the rates rebate often don’t know how much they earn. As many are on Superannuation or Work and Income benefits we can ask if they’re on one of these income sources, as the amounts are known. We also found that there was some embarrassment about income and about asking for any form of help which was a barrier to applying, so we designed an anonymous calculation step at the beginning of the service so people don’t have to go through a full application before they find out if they are eligible for anything (which is the current process). We found users that had gone through days of effort to apply, only to discover they were entitled to 30 cents. (Above: an example of the user journey when using the pilot digital application) User Interface/User Experience development The user interface, online eligibility calculator and web app went through testing with citizens, Tauranga City Council Service and Support Centre staff, as well as with DIA Rates Rebates staff throughout development. Testing with prototypes built in Atomic, a web based mockup tool, meant that we were able to make changes on the fly while testing and getting feedback. To read more on this prototyping and see some of the work in progress prototypes go to https://www.digital.govt.nz/blog/labplus-rates-rebates-prototyping/ Feedback on the prototypes was very positive. There were many iterations of language style used and testing helped us find language that we felt was appropriate, and read as the plainest English. Feedback from digital pilot users in Tauranga “I didn’t know government things could be like this” - User testing “I’m partially blind, so if things are on a computer I can zoom in and read them” - First applicant on Tauranga pilot “That was easy, wasn’t it!” - Pilot applicant “I would do it online next time” - Pilot applicant “That was easier than I thought!” - Pilot applicant Opportunities for digitising the application By making the application digital we were able to show where improvements could be made to the system and processes of the service. There are opportunities for integration with Rating Information Databases from local councils, local council information management systems, as well as central government systems. Other benefits of a digital service are that changes to the entitlement can be implemented in a shorter period of time, such as the income threshold and maximum entitlement, which are reviewed every year and often changed. Investing in a creating a digital application channel and changing legislation to remove the need for a statutory declaration would mean a lower cost of implementation to citizens, councils, and central government (ie DIA, IRD and MSD) due to reduced processing times and cost of printing and moving paper forms. The application process was entirely digital3 and removed the need for paper, as well as considerably reducing the time for customers and processing time for Councils. The estimated time for an applicant to complete the paper form is 25 minutes, with the digital application taking roughly 4 minutes4. Councils also found this reduced time of processing, as they could copy and paste applicant information into their systems instead of typing out by hand, as well as time saved from applications being unable to be submitted with gaps or incomplete sections in the digital form, which is common for paper forms. Appendix 3 shows a physical comparison of the web app vs the current paper application. Insights from discovery and alpha Applicants insights Customer segmentation The majority of current applicants are retired, around 80% of applicants receive New Zealand Superannuation. There is a misconception that Rates Rebates require you to be on NZ Superannuation to be eligible. Supported Living payment recipients and solo parents are another significant demographic of applicants, although more research is needed to confirm demographics due to the lack of information collected on applicants. Lack of awareness We believe that there are many ratepayers who are eligible but do not know about the entitlement. Council rebates and contact centre staff are worried that there are a lot of people out there that need a rebate, but do not know about it. Our research showed that many people find out about the entitlement via word of mouth. – almost by accident, rather than from direct messaging from Local or Central Government. Examples from our research include one ratepayer who had experienced a change in their financial situation after being diagnosed with a serious illness, who was informed about the entitlement from a friend who had learnt about Rates Rebates from the doctor. When rates are not paid, this is a trigger for the Council to proactively reach out to applicants about applying for a rebate. This can often be the way a ratepayer finds out that Rates Rebates exist and that they are entitled to one. Complexity Customers do not find completing the application easy or enjoyable. Collating their information and obtaining evidence from other agencies have been identified as a pain point. It was often said that you have to know the system to get the entitlement, and the application is quite difficult and complex. Comments from citizens interviewed include: “Doesn’t the government know all this stuff about me anyway?” “If this is what I have to do to get some money do I really want to do it?” “People won’t take the money if the value of the trade is too low” [e.g. time, giving up their personal information] Accessibility Both council staff and ratepayers commented that at peak application time, the service centres become very busy with rebate applicants and described scenes where the lines were long, with many in the lines being elderly and council staff bringing out chairs for those who struggle to stand for too long. Some said it “feels like a hospital waiting room” and others worry about how they will complete their Rates Rebates applications when they are older and less able-bodied and/or able-minded. The requirement and logistics of needing to have the application witnessed is a big pain point - especially for those with low mobility. There is also a user perception that there needs to be options for service delivery other than Digital - “What if they don’t have a computer?” Applicants asked: “Why can’t you just do it over the phone?” Cultural expectations A common perception from successful applicants was that there are a lot of people worse off than them who are more deserving to get a rebate. Some applicants expressed that rebates made them feel as if they begging for money now that their main source of income was NZ Superannuation. Quotes from applicants interviewed include: “If I’m entitled to something just give it to me” “It felt like a cross-examination” “It feels like airing your underwear” Since becoming a Superannuitant “I am a second class citizen” “It’s embarrassing having to ask [for a rebate] but you are entitled” Trust in digital and government A single poor experience with computers or automated systems can colour how much trust a customer has around automation. Many ratepayers we interviewed mentioned either themselves or someone they know who’d had a bad experience such as either being scammed or having had a poor customer experience with a company with an online component. Customers often find correspondence from government threatening when it’s addressed to them as an individual. This can lead to communications about entitlements either being missed or misunderstood, as citizens feel that they will not be contacted by the government unless there is a problem. System and process insights Inefficient process The process is very manual and involves costly double handling. Applicants must fill in the same information and apply every year even when their information does not change. Applicants often submit incomplete and incorrect forms which compounds problems further. Ratepayers find the application confusing, leading to forms often completed wrongly , or required fields left blank. If this happens, the applicant must be contacted and then the application re-submitted, delaying when the rebate can be granted which is often at a time when it’s needed most. This results in more double handling. Cost to council Councils can be left waiting for DIA payments to come through after they have discounted customers rates. Many councils are also unhappy with the cost of implementing the facilitating and checking of an entitlement application which cost them staff that could be better used in more high value contacts with their ratepayers. Peak times are hard to staff and manage The majority of applications come at the start of the rating year in August. Due to the number of applications, compared to other months of the year, councils often hire temporary staff for a number of months to help process rebate forms, and DIA have similar issues related to staffing (ie staff are moved from other areas to help out) during this busy period. Service centre support and success of applications Council representatives are an important part of the process and are seen as visible evidence that something is being done to progress their application. For some customers, Council representatives make it worry free and take the stress out of it. Councils often receive thank you cards and calls from customers who have gotten a rebate. The council representatives knowledge and willingness to help make the difference to the experience and success of applications. If there wasn’t this level of assistance, then it is less likely to be a positive experience. But this great customer experience comes at a cost for work that is considered low value compared to more complex ratepayer queries. “Wouldn’t it be great to not need a 50 page handbook” Council staff on understanding Rates Rebate Act (1973) and DIA rules Inconsistent messaging from councils There are inconsistencies across councils on implementation, e.g. when applicants are asked to provide proof, and what information that they give to customers. We mapped information provided on council websites about Rates Rebates and found a large variation in amount and types of information to inform ratepayers about rebates. Prescriptive legislation The legislation is very prescriptive, making it impossible to create an end-to-end digital service. This is impacting the customer experience. The requirement for a statutory declaration has been identified as a key issue. Next Steps Both the discovery and the alpha identified that there is desirability to progress the alpha service to full production from both an applicant and local councils perspective and the Lab is currently supporting DIA to explore how to transition the alpha to a Beta. A beta is developing a service to meet demands of a live environment, including understanding how to build and scale the service while continuously meeting user needs. This transition work involves understanding the viability of the service from a business owner perspective (ie development, implementation and ongoing costs) and the feasibility from a technology perspective of implementing the alpha into production. The goal being to identify a range of options that could be applied to deliver a production version of the service for DIA leadership consideration. Next steps will consist of: a workshop to explore the collective goals we have for the service and initial options that could be explored in more detail post workshop Detailed exploration of the initial options and identification of other if appropriate Recommendation and decision by DIA to stop or commit to a roadmap for delivery that could include engaging with more Councils, more user testing and research, more development or full development. DIA as custodian of the Rates Rebates will ultimately make a decision based on the work done and their own priorities on whether or not to continue the development to full production. The New Zealand Society of Local Government Managers (SOLGM) has made a submission for the Local Government Regulatory Systems Amendment Bill, to better support online applications for rates rebate by removing the requirement for an officer of the council (or anyone) to witness the statutory declaration. This would make the implementation of a truly online application process possible. The alpha identified in practice how the statutory declaration is out of step with digital service delivery. This issue is being referred to the required Policy teams to investigate if statutory declarations could be replaced for other services as well as the Rates Rebates. Recommendations if approved to production If the alpha is developed further to production we recommend exploring these areas for service improvements: Work with Inland Revenue and Ministry of Social Development to allow for consented income testing to make it easier for applicants to prove their income. Work with other agencies such as Ministry of Social Development to integrate the rates rebate application into applications for other services, such as applying for Jobseekers, Supported Living, NZ Superannuation etc. Consistent messaging across agencies - After discovering the inconsistent messages about rebates across councils and agencies, there is potential for work to improve consistency across councils on messaging regarding Rates Rebates. We mapped the information across councils with large variations found: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uHktpWj03FKFX0F0Hn7GK9pg1sMxBKaaPfjA8Gd_ra8/edit#gid=0 Potential for greater link with Superannuation - A large portion of rebate receivers are retired and on superannuation. There is potential to use this as a vehicle to help either gain awareness of the entitlement and/or to use this to make application easier. Many councils do not verify income if the applicant is on super, as many on super do not know their gross income and are on the same amount. Engage more user groups - On testing, we suggest more engagement with a range of user groups who require additional relationship building then the short time that the sprint process allowed. It would also benefit system improvement to invest in understanding cultural attitudes around receiving money/help to improve uptake of the entitlement. This came up in research as an issue, but due to limited timeframes and scope was not able to be investigated deeper. Translation to other languages - Councils identified that they had applicants who had low levels of fluency in English and found applying difficult. It was common for the council teams to find a workmate who spoke the language deal with these applications, and also for these staff to move on leaving the teams unable to deal with applicants with low English. Having a digital application would allow for pages to translated and easily switched to languages such as Samoan, Hindi and Mandarin. Appendix One - Service Blueprints DIA Rates rebates completed forms processing: Current state This blueprint helped us to see where manual handling was in place once forms were sent to DIA, and where opportunities for cost/time saving through digitisation could be found. Rates rebates Alpha Blueprint This blueprint shows how the Rates Rebates pilot in Tauranga service structured, and helps show what needed to be built and what existing systems could be used without changes required. Future State Blueprint This blueprint shows a potential future where information sharing between agencies is used to provide proactive delivery of the rebates entitlement. Appendix Two - Trends analysis The following charts describe the number of claims made for the last three years and the timings of when the applications are made to the Councils. The majority of applications are made in August each year and to mitigate the high workload on existing council staff, temporary staff are brought in to help process these. DIA audit these applications and their busy time falls between Aug and Oct when they verify the claims. Reasons why claims are refused and cancelled include: The applicant earned more income than The application was incorrectly completed The applicant didn’t live at the location advised The applicant had an undeclared partner There is anecdotal evidence from this study most are due to misunderstandings of the form and the application process. Dropping number of rebates claimed each year The number of Rates Rebates claimed each year has been dropping. This is a well known trend and is mostly due to the income threshold not keeping in pace with the rise in superannuation payments year to year, leading to those on the couples super especially, gradually dropping out of eligibility. There are some other factors that are potentially affecting this, including rates of homeownership and other factors. Home Ownership rates lowest in 66 years In 2017 homeownership rates in New Zealand were at the lowest they had been for 66 years at 63.2 percent of people today live in a home they owned, the lowest rate of ownership since the 1951 Census with rates recorded at 61.2 percent5. Awareness of Rates Rebates There is anecdotal evidence that suggests that awareness of the entitlement is low. Due to current measurement practices we don’t know how many people are eligible and what are the reasons that they don’t apply (eg they choose not to, the application process is seen as complicated and confusing). The later point is consistent problem with most government services or any services for that matter - why does someone not use your service? To answer this question for Rates Rebates would require data analysis and user research. Cost of housing increasing Stats NZ data shows an upwards trend in the cost of housing since 2007. There has been an 8.0 percent increase in the weekly cost of housing from 2014/2014 to 2015/2016. Stats NZ say that this increase was mostly due to households spending more on mortgage payments (up 12.8 percent) and property rates (up 9.6 percent). In comparison, renting costs over the same period increased by 1.8 percent6. New Zealand’s access to the internet Internet NZ reports that approximately connection7. This has an impact on people’s ability to find out about their entitlements with most service providers moving to digital channels. It also put more emphasis on designing for mobile as this will be the preferred channel that people will access internet in the future. Continuing development of the rates rebate alpha will need to keep in mind both of these points.

Why this topic At December 2017 there were 1.9 million private dwellings for 4.9 million New Zealanders. Of these, 588,700 (37% of total dwellings) were private rental households, and made up the majority of rental houses. The proportion of New Zealanders renting increased from 23% in 1991 to 33% in 2016. In addition, people are renting for more of their lives, or permanently. Māori, Pacific peoples, and families with children are over-represented in renting statistics, while people are increasingly renting in retirement. Housing not only fulfils the basic human need for shelter but also satisfies social requirements. A house provides a centre for an individual and the basis for family life, emerging as an important symbol of social standing and aspiration. Meeting housing needs is therefore complex. Many rentals don’t support their occupants well when compared with owner-occupied houses: 31% of rental houses feel damp, compared to 11% of owner- occupied houses 22% of rental homes have no fixed heating sources 56% of rental homes had visible mould, compared to 44% of owner-occupied houses1 The importance of rental accomodation led the Service Innovation governance group, which MBIE belongs to, to prioritise ‘Renting a Property’as a life event to explore from a holistic, all-of-government perspective. How did we do it Our initial design statement was based on a hypothesis that a better rental house will result in a better relationship between tenant and landlord. The aim was to find out more about these relationships and the house itself. We essentially began with a fact finding mission as a foundation for future work. Significant research had already been undertaken. We built on this, reviewing over 48 documents that provided insights into renting from landlord, property manager and tenant perspectives and conducted in-depth interviews with 60 stakeholders. We also explored wellbeing frameworks relevant to renting, including the Māori concept of Kāinga. What did we learn We validated our original design statement by the end of week three, but with a twist. It was actually better relationships that influence the quality of the homes. Tenants who had good relationships were less likely to go into dispute with their landlords, more likely to raise issues, and see improvements, thus increasing house quality. As a result we revised our design statement: For tenants and landlords renting a property, create ways to raise recognition that better relationships between them aid in quality rental homes which will help lead to better outcomes for both. Key themes and patterns of behaviour to explore further: Relationships and communication - Good relationships are essential to trust and transparency. This enables all parties to better understand each other, and make it more likely to facilitate ways to help each other. As a result, all parties had higher chances of securing tenure, trusting one another in the longer-term and improving rental stock. Rental culture - Tenants, landlords and property managers said increased challenges in the rental market has caused a dysfunctional culture. Tenants worried about being “kicked out”. Some landlords and tenants faced discrimination and public stigma, which in turn led to shame for owning a rental property, or decrease their chances of finding somewhere to live. Housing is a human right - Tenants frequently experience difficulty in finding a home, with some sacrificing their resources, and some families in desperate need; many face the challenge of proving their worth as a “good” tenant and although some were determined, others felt vulnerable, judged, and unheard. Housing is a human right that some New Zealanders are excluded from. Poor and learnt behaviour - There were enough stories to indicate a lack of rental knowledge, training and experience in renting was low or immature for many of the players. Poor and learnt behaviour has damaged public perceptions of these groups. The basics are essential to living - Tenants, landlords and property managers expressed the importance of having the essentials (including social and community networks) close by rentals to meet basic daily needs of tenants. Many tenants were either unable to access or were unaware of tenancy support services. With a short term discovery, it wasn’t possible to tackle all the themes and problems, so two were selected to investigate further by looking at the causes and coming up with ideas to mitigate them: Security of tenure of a home for a period of time Many landlords and property managers have a lack of experience around tenancy From here we identified several high level ideas to show what future interventions might be. Due to limited time, each of these ideas and the evidence that supports them, will need to be validated in more detail to ascertain the true value of progressing this work further. Using our research Our partners, MBIE Tenancy Services, have used this work for: Design and development of a possible Tenancy Agreement Builder – direct outcome/concept from the discovery, supported by the evidence gathered. Tenancy Bond Strategy – informing further research into the strategic role and direction of Tenancy Bond Healthy Homes Standards campaign strategy – feeding into research for the strategic direction of public engagement with the Healthy Homes Standards Multiple stakeholder engagement strategies with various audiences (e.g. Property Managers; Māori; etc.) Looking into the viability of setting up online training modules that support Tenants, Landlords and Property Managers A primer for new staff, and to raise awareness of the importance of relationships, behaviour change, tenant fear and other problems in the market.

Phase two of the discovery took place over four weeks. The core team received support from subject matter experts (SME) across government agencies. The team did a detailed analysis of the findings from the first discovery and collected new information from SMEs to validate the problems and next steps. Validation In order to be able to enter the design phase where we can design, build, test and learn, we needed to understand the following from discovery research: What is the problem? Who is it a problem for? When is it happening? We would likely fail to have any impact unless we identify the “who, what and when” before we start. We discovered in phase one of our research that there are complex relationship dynamics associated with renting. The relationships are person to person, and also between people and property. Next, we defined each type of relationship, how it works, and what makes a relationship good. A good relationship can include the following: Issues are raised without fear Issues are resolved in a timely manner Rapport - (know names, situation etc) Consideration of actions Going above and beyond requirements Taking pride in their house and responsibilities Autonomy Maintain the mana and integrity of the other person or persons in the relationship We noted that defined responsibilities and expectations are important to reducing conflict or managing it when it arises through accountability. Similarly, transparency encourages fairness and equality, and manages the expectations of both parties. The outcomes Through the analysis and validation we identified these key insights: There is strong evidence that the barriers to a ‘quality relationship’ between the parties to a tenancy start before the actual tenancy commences. There is an opportunity to be pre-emptive as it is the time before a tenancy starts in which the relationship between landlords and tenant is most critical. The events of this time have a long term impact throughout renting life journey. There is strong evidence that removing known barriers at the beginning of the renting relationship can reduce the likelihood of issues and conflict arising during a tenancy and increases a quick resolution. Based on these insights, two key issues stand out. Both these issues occur before people start renting a property. Securing a property to rent Forming a tenancy agreement. We identified segments of people that are struggling to acquire a rental property. This could be for a variety of reasons, but we think it would be an ideal cohort to work with as there is an excellent opportunity to achieve collective impact by applying a cross-agency approach with these groups.

During this period, young adults are not only defining who they are and what they care about, but they may also be entering tertiary study or further training, becoming a parent, getting a job, leaving home, moving to another region or going overseas. Becoming an adult in New Zealand looks very different for each person and can be influenced by many variables. The ‘becoming an adult’ project was undertaken by a cross-branch DIA team to look into improving how young adults access government services and prove who they are (manage their identity). Project objectives Understand the current state of identity management for 16-20 year olds and the role digital identity currently has in their lives. Test assumptions around the experience, use of and value of digital identity for accessing government services. Identify opportunities and future trends that could support this cohort in accessing services. Our approach The project was the first chance for the whole design team at the Service Innovation Lab to work together to not only achieve the brief faster but consolidate our approach on how we run research discoveries. Part of this was to test our new measurement framework to better understand what good work looks like at a project level. For more detail read What Does ‘Good’ Look Like? Innovation in Public Service Design. The project team comprises a product owner, 4 service designers and a scrum master, and the work was undertaken over 12 weeks. With a limited timeframe to complete the research the team used the following approach: Semi-structured interviews 1.5 hours long with tailored activities around control and independence, identity and online behaviour. Desk research on emerging trends, literature review and analysis, and testing of existing services. Connected with identity experts and projects across government. Tools To help guide our interviews from broad to narrow areas of interest we designed a series of activities and tools. In particular, we wanted to deep dive into what control/independence looked like to young adults as well as how they gained and used various types of attributes and information about themselves online and in person. The tools were designed to make it easy to translate the findings into quantifiable data to identify patterns across our cohort. Alongside these activities we asked about online behaviour, privacy concerns, plans and aspirations. The other benefit of using tools and activities was to give consistency in the quality and type of data collected, as the interviews were being conducted by a larger team with different levels of experience and confidence with this type of research. Who we met The team interviewed 10 young adults aged 16 to 21. They were carefully recruited to give us a diverse set of perspectives over a demographic representation. The group contained a range of ethnic, refugee and migrant backgrounds: a mix of rural, urban and living away from home as well as high and low decile schooling. The team decided longer interviews with less people was the right balance to meet our objectives and identify patterns. What we learnt Even from our small sample we managed to collect a wealth of data that could be used to inform actionable insights and challenge a bunch of assumptions. The tools performed well both in the field and during analysis of the data. We also validated our findings against academic studies and research being undertaken by a variety of organisations in New Zealand and abroad to build a bigger picture of where the young adults we spoke to fit in at scale. Influences During their transition to adulthood, young people are defining their identity; who they are as individuals and what they care about, support or believe. Many were struggling to manage the pressures and influences put on them by parents, peers, family and even themselves. Some were compromising doing something they were passionate about for something that would get them employment, financial stability or would allow them to travel. Responsibility Research by Massey University on the topic reveals young adults today aren’t taking on the adult roles and responsibilities in the way previous generations had. While they are legally able to do many tasks on their own, most got help from parents and siblings to access services, such as applying for government support and passports. This made it difficult to understand pain-points as young adults might not be experiencing them directly because others were doing this for them, or they were not doing it frequently enough to remember. For example, when asked about applying for their driver’s licence many could tell us in detail about the test and studying for it, yet none were sure about completing the application process. Their guardians were often left looking after their “serious” or “important” identity documents even after the person had left home. Technology use We were very surprised at their attitude toward technology. Most said they used it frequently, yet there was a real awareness of the negative impact it can have on their lives. Clear distinctions were made between using it for something productive or educational — or for recreation, such as social media. Some even went so far as to monitor the time they spent on their phone and were actively trying to reduce it. Identity in visuals The following diagrams visualise when young adults are creating new IDs and which IDs are most used. The diagram is a horizontal line with birth at the left end and turning 21 at the right end. The line is punctuated by dots indicating when IDs are acquired and the size of the dot grows based on how many of our cohort were included. The diagram reveals that all had birth certificates and only a few acquired IDs between their childhood and the age of 13 where the majority of ID activity occurs until about 17 years old followed by a minor amount into early 20s. This diagram shows our 10 young adults all had birth certificates and later between 13 and 17 years old acquired many other IDs, such as driver’s licences and online accounts, such as Google and Facebook. The diagram below shows the strong use of online IDs and large ownership of government issued IDs. Note that we included a wide range of items that might not technically be considered forms of identity but this was to understand young adults perception and awareness of government issued documents. This diagram uses 2 axes, ownership and usage, to plot various types of identity documents and cards young adults had in their wallet or at home. We used this diagram to understand what was the most commonly owned and most used forms of ID. The key insights from this graph is that bank cards, student IDs, Facebook and Google accounts made up the most owned and used followed closely by drivers licence. The least used and owned IDs were Kiwi Access card and firearms licence. There was a cluster of IDs that many people owned but didn’t frequently use which was made up of many government issued IDs such as birth certificate, passport, IRD number and national student number. Full information on the insights gathered in the Becoming an Adult project can be made available so get in touch. We’ll publish another blog post soon on how we’re exploring ways to share user research.

This includes exploring a structural rewrite to provide a modern and responsive piece of legislation that supports effective and efficient delivery of the accident compensation scheme. While exploring opportunities to make the AC Act more accessible and fit for purpose from a structural rewrite, MBIE and ACC learned about ‘machine consumable’ legislation, and the work of the ‘better rules – better outcomes’ (‘Better Rules’) initiative and the Service Innovation Lab. Machine consumable legislation means that its rules can be presented in a structured format (code) that can be processed by a machine (computer) without human intervention. It recognises that machines are ubiquitous, services are increasingly consumed digitally, and there are many uses for machine consumable legislation that are only beginning to be explored. The Better Rules initiative is examining ways to support this through the way New Zealand regulation is developed and implemented, and the Service Innovation Lab previously facilitated a similar experiment. Approach The cross-agency and multidisciplinary Accident Compensation Better Rules Discovery Team (‘the team’) undertook a ‘discovery’ (experiment) over six weeks of half-days based at the Service Innovation Lab starting March 2019. The team comprised legal, policy, legal drafting, business rules, operational, and software development experts from ACC, MBIE, the Parliamentary Counsel Office, the Department of Internal Affairs (‘Internal Affairs’), the Inland Revenue Department (‘Inland Revenue’), and the Service Innovation Lab. The discovery aimed to develop a blueprint of rules for entitlements in the AC Act by developing concept models, decision models, rules statements, and code. The discovery was to support a potential structural rewrite of the AC Act through: creating a shared understanding of the rules for entitlements; exploring use of machines to identify gaps in logic of the rules; providing a practical example that shows how this approach can be applied; and developing tools and techniques that could be applied to future work. The team recognised that it was unrealistic to complete this blueprint for all entitlements in this time, and developed a prioritised list of entitlements to work through. Key findings Rules statements are of significant value for legal drafters: Rules statements – a simple set of rules synthesised from complex legislation – that have been robustly developed and tested are expected to assist the Parliamentary Counsel Office (legal drafters) to undertake a more comprehensive and accurate rewrite that is more human and machine consumable. Developing rules statements identified gaps: The process of developing rules statements identified gaps in the logic of legislation that had not been previously identified, which range from technical gaps that could be resolved by legal drafters through to gaps that require further analysis. By resolving these logic gaps, legislation can be more human and machine consumable, the risk of misinterpretation can be reduced, and what is implemented can better match policy intent. Legislation may have longer rules and more of them: A prevailing view in the team at the beginning of the discovery was that a structural rewrite would result in fewer or shorter rules to make the AC Act more accessible and human consumable. To the contrary, the team found that ensuring there are no gaps in the rule logic can result in longer rules. However, these longer rules were clearer and would ensure legislation is more human and machine consumable. Furthermore, as legislation becomes machine consumable, and policy developers have tools to better understand and model its (positive and negative) effects, additional rules may be created to create more nuanced policy. Developing rules statements and code at the same time most effective: The discovery initially explored handing rules statements to software developers for turning into code. However, it was found that writing code at the same time as rules statements produced better quality rules statements and code, and was more efficient. It improved shared understanding, reduced follow up questions, and allowed the code to validate the rules statements. Concept models improved shared understanding: The use of concept models as the first step for any new topic improved shared understanding and team engagement. They showed not only what was in scope but also what was out and enabled focused and effective communication. Concept models proved to be a core first step for the multi-disciplinary team to start working on each entitlement. A small multidisciplinary team can produce most outputs: While the discovery had a broader team to draw on (and who were all used), the outputs that would support a structural rewrite were produced with a small team (fewer than six) of experts across business rules, operations, policy, legal, legal drafters, and software development. Tools increased efficiency and broadened use of code: During the discovery, the team identified areas where different tools may have been of value, including tools for capturing concept models, tools that can test policy, and tools for storing rules in a dataset form from which executable legislation as code could be derived. The team experimented with tools and found that they demonstrated value and (at least in one case) were complementary to each other, but neither is necessary for a structural rewrite alone. Rules requiring human judgement can be written in code: The team explored developing code for an area of legislation requiring significant human judgement to test whether it is difficult to code, and found it was no different or more complex than other rules. It emerged that identifying these types of rules could be used to track the quantity of human judgement within a piece of legislation, which could provide a new perspective and way to measure how much a piece of legislation introduces. Value of software developers is beyond code: The software developers brought a lot of value to the multi-disciplinary team that was beyond the code they create. They looked at rules and logic on behalf of the machine, and improved the logic and robustness of rules statements. A multidisciplinary team improves implementation: Using a multidisciplinary team to develop rules statements improved connections of people involved in policy development through to those in operations, and was observed to reduce translation gaps and is expected to improve implementation. It also sped up the cadence of work as the experts were in the room at the right time, eliminating handover errors and delays that usually occur when experts from a different team provide input. Opportunities Develop rules statements for other parts of the AC Act: To support legal drafters to ensure a structural rewrite would result in more human and machine consumable legislation, MBIE and ACC should develop rules statements for all provisions in the AC Act that may benefit from this work. A pragmatic approach would be to develop a prioritised list of provisions that would benefit most from rules statements, and scope the effort (time and resources) to complete that work in the time available. This does not require another intensive discovery, but rather could use regular discrete blocks of time (eg, 4 hours per week over six months). To develop code that tests the logic, a software developer is required. Use methods from the discovery for other policy and legislative changes: While the focus has been on a structural rewrite, the approach tested across the six-week discovery could also be used as part of everyday business when considering policy and legislative changes. While this is particularly true for the AC Act, which is complex and composed of many interrelated provisions, considering different policy and legislative proposals against rules statements and code would robustly test their logic and implications. Improve macro view through concept models: MBIE and ACC should seek opportunities to improve the macro view of accident compensation scheme settings through concept models. This could give a transparent and consistent view of the accident compensation scheme, and provide a common foundation for cross-agency collaboration, in the same way the smaller and more targeted concept models did for the discovery. Code the whole AC Act and make it public: To fully support the long-term ambition of machine consumable legislation in New Zealand, ACC, MBIE, the Better Rules initiative, and the Service Innovation Lab could explore coding the whole AC Act. Much of the AC Act would have been coded as part of the process of creating the rules statements. A key realisation of the potential of machine consumable legislation is publicly publishing the code in an executable form for the same reasoning governments publish their legislative text: to aid people’s comprehension of the law. Coding the AC Act would be dependent on the Better Rules initiative completing its planned work on developing New Zealand standards and architecture for machine consumable legislation. Continue to explore using code already developed: Some code has already been developed as part of the process to develop rules statements (and more would be developed if the rules statements are developed). This code presents a unique opportunity for innovation. For example, it could be used for policy development (eg, modelling test cases), for consumers or advocates to develop an end-user interface, or for government to see how the accident compensation legislation interacts with other legislation. Working with the Better Rules initiative and the Service Innovation Lab, ACC and MBIE should continue to explore this so that the opportunity is not wasted. NOTE The full report about this discovery is available as a PDF; however we are currently working on an accessible version of this for future release. As always we would like to know your thoughts and comments about the Better Rules work so please make contact with us."},{"title":"Service Innovation Lab - Using Kumu to share our research","url":"/2019/07/10/Using-Kumu-To-Share-Our-Research/","tags":["better public services"],"body":"The Service Innovation Lab often undertakes design research into topics that impact multiple agencies and the teams within them. That means it’s important to share our learnings in a way that supports a number of work streams and potentially reduces the need for repeat user research. Testing ways to share our findings While many other people are interested in the specific topic/s associated with our work, such as accessing services, identity and privacy concerns, our project team thought the Becoming an Adult project would be a good scenario to test a different way to share our findings. The usual outcome of our research would be a report and/or presentation; this provides a highly curated view of the data relevant to our project objectives. Furthermore, in the process of doing field research you often learn a bunch of things not specifically related to the project objectives — but this data might be useful to others. This prototype looked at how to share the collected data with others to assess its connection and usefulness to their work. This involved digitising all the data we found compelling from our transcripts, even where it didn’t have a direct link to our key insights. Visual presentation We met potential consumers of this data and realised it would be useful to present our findings visually. The goal was to provide an at-a-glance view of any data in our transcripts and enabling potential consumers to easily and quickly search or identify topics of interest. This would enable other project teams to not only decide if there was relevant data but understand our logic — from insight to verbatim quotes that could then be referenced in transcripts for full context. Combining Kumu with Google Sheets The tool we chose to test this idea was Kumu . However, we didn’t want to be bound to a particular tool, so we chose to create a database using Google Sheets that could be tested with other tools. Combining Kumu with the Google Sheets app dramatically sped up the process of data entry and validation, as both apps could be accessed and updated by multiple users simultaneously. This enabled quick updating and version history of the data and visualisation. Digitising the data We estimate it took two team members a day and a half to enter all the data from post-it notes into spreadsheet format, ready to be imported into Kumu. At this point the data in Kumu reflected what we had analysed as a team and posted on the wall. From here, time was spent familiarising ourselves with Kumu and how we could further synthesise and arrange the data beyond what’s viable with post-its. This is when we really started to notice the power of Kumu to highlight areas in our data that needed attention and when data entry errors were corrected. We re-drew how we wanted the data to be organised, and revised hierarchies on a whiteboard to help inform data cleaning and create a less confusing visual. Presenting data in a shareable and reusable format Overall, this process felt faster to get to a shareable and reusable format for our target users (researchers and designers). The process of digitising and recreating the synthesis also added extra rigor to our analysis as it was an opportunity to question how we categorised and interpreted the raw data. Kumu enabled the data to be more intricately connected using tags and connections, reflecting a realistic complexity to what we learnt and made the often abstract process of analysis and synthesis more tangible. When we shared this, there was excitement at seeing this type of data presented in such a way and initial reviews are that it feels intuitive, and “certainly a lot easier to go through than other data sets I’ve been given.” Becoming an Adult data in Kumu demo This video shows how Kumu was used to visualise the qualitative data collected as part of the Becoming an Adult research discovery. This was an experiment in sharing research across teams designing and developing identity services in government.

The research was a combination of customer interviews, council and stakeholder observations and conversations, online surveys and analytics analysis. Content Executive Summary Background Methods and Outputs Key insights The system is too complex and multiple errors are occuring Seniors are more digitally capable than many assume Applicants are relinquishing control over to the council and authorities The current process is not accessible to people with disabilities Retirement village residents were well supported and have wrap around services There is a significant appetite for various forms of automation Eligible applicants are not applying because their personal data is not private The statutory declaration is a significant barrier to the completion of the process There is a need for human contact and support Newly bereaved need additional help with the application process Leverage the best channels for awareness and support Appendix Automation feedback Completing the paper application form Frequently used channels Executive Summary The Rates Rebate scheme provides a rebate of rates to eligible ratepayers to assist low-income households. The process is administered by local councils, who are then refunded by central government. The final amount of rebate available to an applicant is calculated by their household income, their total rates bill, and the number of dependants in the household. The Service Innovation Lab were commissioned to work on this initiative and completed a Discovery and Alpha phase. It was identified during the Alpha phase that deeper research and engagement was required to understand the barriers to completion, and how to improve uptake of the entitlement. This research informed the recent Beta phase of the project. The design research was a combination of surveys, analytics and face to face interviews with the applicants and council staff. The research has informed ways to improve the access to the application, and to remove barriers to completion. We have been able to use the results of this research to restructure the online content on govt.nz. We have also been able to advise the DIA Service Delivery and Operations team on how improvements can be made to the existing paper application form to increase legibility, comprehension and accessibility. We’ve identified areas of improvements that can be made to the design of the end to end service to reduce errors, to improve accuracy, accessibility, privacy and efficiency of processing. These improvements will reduce cost and burden on the applicants, council and DIA teams. This also helps move towards delivering on the intent of the Rates Rebate Act. The biggest identified barrier to completion remains the requirement of the Statutory Declaration. “The elderly are very susceptible to winter illnesses, and yet they often come out of their sick beds and warm houses to sign.” COUNCIL STAFF MEMBER The research has helped us understand this audience segment and their trust and perception of government and local council. It has also challenged our initial assumptions about the digital capability of this segment, and have proven that this group are more digitally savvy than perhaps expected by many. They also have a high expectation of interacting online. This research has also informed us on how to better engage with this group with style of language, content structure, and the channels and communities in which to reach them. We’ve identified the friction with processing retirement village applications through the councils, and the current work arounds, and foresee a reduction in uptake across retirement villages in the next rating year. This is something that can be integrated and improved with future iterations of Rates Rebate online. Background What is Rates Rebate The Rates Rebate scheme provides a rebate of rates to eligible ratepayers to assist low-income households. The process is administered by local councils, who are then refunded by central government. Applicants need to apply every year by providing an application form and proof of income to their local council. The maximum rebate available is currently set at $640. The final amount of rebate available to an applicant is calculated by their household income, their total rates bill, and the number of dependants in the household. Who applies for a Rates Rebate Most recipients of a Rates Rebate are superannuitants. In the 2017/18 rating year 79% of all successful applicants were receiving New Zealand Superannuation. Other recipients were 14% employed, 4% on other benefits and 2% unemployed. In February 2018 the Rates Rebate Amendment Act 2018 was passed. This amendment grants those who live in retirement villages eligibility to receive rates rebates (in the form of a refund). As a result of this change, uptake is expected to increase in coming years. The total number of ratepayers eligible for a rates rebate is not known. What work has been done by the Lab for Rates Rebate The Lab produced and tested an Alpha prototype with Tauranga City Council between May and September 2018. The Alpha proved to be of high value to ratepayers and Councils, and successfully tested a fully digital and user centred end to end rates rebate process. It was identified during this Alpha phase that deeper research and engagement was required to understand the barriers to completion, and how to improve uptake of the entitlement. This would help the team understand the nuances of this group and to understand the cultural attitudes around receiving money or help from institutions. The Beta phase focused on further refining the service based on further user research and feedback from ratepayers and three councils. This report is a summary of the research findings with applicants and council staff. Methods Research Questions The two primary areas being explored with the Rates Rebate beta were; could a solution like this increase uptake of the Rates Rebate, and could it improve customer experience and satisfaction levels (also the Outputs section for more). In order to inform solution design, both for the beta phase and beyond, we determined we needed answers to the following questions. What is the current state of awareness? What are the best channels for awareness and completion? What is the digital capability of this cohort? What is confusing? What creates blocks to completion? What are the costs (including time, money, cognitive load, dignity)? A variety of research methods were used to get the information we needed. 1. Interviews with applicants In April 2019 we conducted interviews with nine eligible Tauranga ratepayers, over five days. Tauranga City Council helped us identify people we could interview that covered both the majority of eligible customers, and edge cases. The interviewees were recruited by Tauranga City Council, based on residents who had previously applied for a Rates Rebate, and therefore were a fair representation of those eligible and apply for a rates rebate. Eight of the interviewees were over 65 and receiving superannuation. One interviewee was receiving an alternative benefit. The interviewees were a mix of people who lived in retirement villages and their own homes. They included people with English as a second language, and people with reduced mobility. The semi-structured interviews ran for 1.5 hours, and were conducted in people’s homes, retirement village rooms, and the local library. The interview process was a mix of visual cards to prompt dialog on current and future states, card sorting to reveal degrees of difficulty in the process, and potential supporting channels, filling in the existing paper application to identify what is confusing and a barrier to completion. Interviews were recorded by dictaphone, and photos taken of relevant steps. The recordings have been transcribed for analysis. 2. Conversations with council staff & Department Internal Affairs Conversations were conducted with Tauranga City Council, Hutt City Council, and Kāpiti District Council throughout the Beta phase. We observed the processing of applications at each council, and the unique system each council used. Additional conversations were held with Wairarapa councils to understand their process and pain points. We worked alongside subject matter experts from Rates Rebates team, within the Service Delivery and Operations branch at DIA. 3. Online surveys Survey research targeted existing visitors to the Rates Rebates section of govt.nz. Two surveys ran during the Beta project. The initial survey ran for two weeks at the start of the project, before any changes had been made to the content. A follow up survey ran for three weeks during the Beta trial to gauge visitors perception of the process and the changes implemented on the online application form. 4. Analytics analysis We identified a set of data that we could pull from analytics on the original Rates Rebates section of govt.nz. This helped us understand current baseline behaviour, search patterns and plan appropriate content structure. The process and the results of this are available as a blog: ‘Rates Rebate - content changes lead to better experience, more users’ Outputs Synthesis Once we had gathered all the data, we went through multiple steps of analysis and outputs. Because this activity was conducted in parallel with the Beta build, we were only able to implement improvements based on early insights immediately into the design of the service. Additional insights have surfaced as we have put the Beta online trial into production. It is hoped these can drive further improvements beyond Beta. The results from this research inform how we might Help increase the uptake of the Rates Rebate Improve customer experience and satisfaction levels Decrease the cost of processing applications for councils Improve the ability to digitally deliver this and other services to councils Support the case to remove the statutory declaration (witnessed signature) requirement Reuse these insights for other use cases that have similar customer profiles This report was produced in parallel with the Rates Rebates Beta Recommendations Report which documents the key results of the trial, presents options for next steps, and makes a set of recommendations. Key insight #1 The system is too complex and multiple errors are occuring. Ratepayers find the current paper application form confusing. This leads to forms often being completed incorrectly, or required fields left blank. Applicants often perceive the ‘rates’ and ‘income’ step as easy, yet will frequently get this information wrong. Councils suspect there are a large number of ratepayers not applying because the process is so daunting. The rates amount required is a combination of local, regional and water rates which differ across regions. Applicants rarely have this information at hand, and can misinterpret what is needed. Councils have requested the rates field to be removed completely from the application form, as staff were continually correcting this data. Occasionally the information will be corrected after the statutory declaration has been signed. Retirement village residents don’t know how much they pay in rates, and rely on the village administrators to provide additional information to allow them to complete the application process. The income amount required is the total income from the previous year, before tax. Applicants often enter their income based on what appears in their bank account, then do a rough calculation to add it up to a year. This results in an inaccurate amount. Income amounts for benefits change depending on the year and individual circumstances, and very few people know the exact amount. DIA have supplied an income guide to councils to assist in helping applicants fill in the amounts. Having a list of possible incomes was helpful as a checklist prompt for applicants, but some didn’t know which benefit category they were in. Some didn’t bother to declare interest on investments because they considered the amounts too small to be relevant. “I’m thinking, surely you want to know what I actually get, not what was there before tax” “Proof of income - that was blimmin hard” The definition of Dependants was commonly misunderstood by both applicants and council staff. This meant that applicants may miss claiming for a dependant family member who live in their household. This can impact their eligibility for a rebate. Details about a dependant are not legally required by the Act, and asking for this data may add a barrier to completion. Multiple dates in the application are difficult to understand and remember. A lot of people enter information for the wrong year. Some applicants mistakenly apply more than once a year. Key insight #2 Seniors are more digitally capable than many assume. Superannuitants are using websites and apps to achieve a wide range of tasks. There is high use of PCs, laptops, tablets and mobile phones in this demographic. Interaction online allows the applicants to apply in their own time and at their own pace. The barrier identified is access to the hardware and internet services rather than the ability to use digital systems. Three quarters of the superannuitants interviewed are interacting online and are digitally savvy. Facebook, Skype and emails are commonly used to connect friends and family. A large proportion use these applications for video calling, sharing photos, and sending messages. Google is used for searching and map locations. Appointments, sports games and holiday accommodation were booked online. Tracking apps were used to measure fitness and performance in walking and golf. Purchases were made through Trademe and Amazon. Ancestry was also used to explore and track genealogy. Various surveys, competitions and special offers were completed online. “Google is amazing what you can find” “It needs to be simple” “The iPad is just part of me - it sits next to me in the arm chair” “Even oldies have got their phone - what would you do without it?” Online banking is popular, but this demographic were also very wary of sharing their bank details online due to a lot of publicity about scamming. Retirement village residents have no problem writing their bank account details on the paper declaration form for the application process. This is because there is a high level of trust that authorities will keep their information safe. Further testing will be needed to investigate comfort levels if bank account details are required for the online process, when village residents are applying for a refund. Financial constraints were stated as a barrier to either replacing technology that had stopped working, or buying a new mobile phone or tablet. The main requirements of using digital devices and systems is that it needs to be easy, and the users need to be in control. Key insight #3 Applicants are passing over control of their application to council and authorities. Councils inform us that applicants often leave required fields or entire application form empty, and trust that council staff will enter or edit details correctly on their behalf. Although the applicants are signing the statutory declaration, they are doing so because they have a high level of trust in the decisions made by their local council staff. The application process is often seen as being complicated, so applicants often allow council to guide them through the application, and make suggested inputs and changes. There is a lack of clarity around the role council staff have in authenticating the proof of income. This can mean that the responsibility of verification frequently falls to the council staff member, rather than the ownership of the declaration staying with the applicant. There are some applicants who will leave a large folder with documentation, expecting the council to check complex account details. We have heard from these customers that they need financial security, freedom, and to be in control of decision making. They like to track what has been done and when, and keep a paper trail of the process. This contrasts with the ease in which they are handing control over to other entities and authorities. “It’s just government stuff. I’m not bothered. I’m past it now, you know, caring” They don’t question those perceived as authorities. They have a high level of trust in local council and government, trust in the retirement village operators, and trust advice given by their accountants and lawyers. There is a lack of need to understand the complexity of the process, and a level of comfort in passing the decisions over to other authorities. “A lot of it was done for us. It just made it really really easy” Retirement village residents relied on the village administrators to provide the additional supplementary form information. There were some applications that were stalled at council, unable to be processed, because the retirement village administrators had not provided the additional paperwork. There is no guarantee that these forms will be supplied to allow the application to be processed, and the applicants to receive their reimbursement. Key insight #4 The current process is not accessible to people with disabilities. With approximately 11% of the target audience vision impaired, 49% with a physical disability, and 59% with a disability of some kind, there is a high need for the process to be fully accessible. The applicants interviewed all used reading glasses and struggled to read the smaller text on the paper application form. If the application form is accessed as a downloadable pdf, it’s possible to enlarge the text, but the content doesn’t reflow into the screen, therefore comprehension is compromised. The downloadable pdf hasn’t been tagged with appropriate markup labels, therefore is not accessible to those using screen reader technology. “I’m partially blind, so if things are on a computer I can zoom in and read them” The process of Rates Rebate is complex and the wording confusing, and full of government jargon which places cognitive load onto the applicant. There are multiple dates to remember, and applicants struggle to remember the details of previous applications. A proportion of the interviewed applicants had impaired hearing, and can struggle to comprehend the details of the process when speaking to someone on the phone. Dexterity is impacted and a large proportion of applicants have difficulty writing their details on the form, and the process of signing their signature can be challenging and demeaning. The paper form requires the applicant to repeat a lot of the same information. “Sorry, my fingers don’t work very well” The requirement to physically present to council to sign the declaration can be impossible for people with mobility challenges without getting help from others. This is acknowledged as the most significant barrier to completion. At busy times in the rating year, the applicant will need to stand in a queue while waiting to have their application processed. “Trouble is I can’t walk very far now. My knees and my ankles have packed up. I can’t drive at the moment because my shoulder’s packed” Key insight #5 Retirement village residents were well supported and had wrap around services. In February 2018 an amendment was made to the Rates Rebate Act to grant those who live in retirement villages eligible to receive rates rebates (in the form of a refund). This first eligible rating year has been supported by local councils, with a concerted effort to reach retirement villages in their region to give support, information and additional service. Local councils have provided reach and information to residents through the support network of each village. The council staff visited retirement villages to help support and process the application, and provide the necessary additional forms. The applicants had the application forms brought to them, the supplementary rating declaration provided through the village, and the council visiting to help with enquires and witnessing signatures. This removed the need for applicants to visit their council to sign the statutory declaration. As a result the experience of village residents has been very positive, and for most, the first time applying for a rates rebate reimbursement. There were some examples of information getting misconstrued between villages, local council and the residents, but the applicants generally found the process straightforward and easy. “For living in the village, it’s just really easy, we don’t have to remember because they come to us” “They were very helpful, the lady that was here” However, the rates paid by residents are not transparent or readily available, and applicants rely on the village administrators to supply this information to them, and to provide the authorised signatures on the supplementary information form. If the village administrators do not supply this information, then the application form cannot be processed. There were examples of applications waiting at council offices, that could not be processed because the supporting documentation from the village administrators had not been completed. Further research is recommended to observe the next rating year and the uptake from this segment as the local councils will not be providing the same level of promotion or visits to the villages. Key insight #6 There is a significant appetite for automation. Results from surveys and interviews indicate that the majority of applicants would prefer to have the form prefilled based on their previous application. There was a significant appetite for allowing government departments to share their data and assumed this is already happening. Eligible ratepayers are surprised that they are required to fill in the form manually every year. This perplexes a lot of people as they find repeating the process of getting the information from separate government authorities inefficient and a waste of time. People’s circumstances don’t generally change each year, yet the same information is required every rating year. While some people kept documents in a folder for easy reference, other applicants lost documentation altogether. This meant that applicants would need to contact Work and Income, Inland Revenue and banking institutions to get documentation for proof of income. There were instances of applicants receiving the wrong information or advice at this step, and either giving up or missing the application date altogether. Dates are difficult to understand and people struggle to remember how they did the process previously. Applicants frequently reapply within the same rating year, not realising they have already applied, and turn up unnecessarily to the council. Some applicants don’t remember to apply from year to year and need to be reminded by their council. Applicants will often identify as names other than what appears on the Rating Information Database, such as middle or shortened names. This can cause slow downs at council when the application is being processed. Current process with paper application requires double handling and repetition of data entry. “What a huge waste of low-income earners time, when we could be working to earn more money.” ONLINE SURVEY “I think all low-income households who have a current community services card entitlement should be able to apply without so much fuss. I currently have to fill in forms, sit and wait at a JP office and then post or physically drop all this into the council.” ONLINE SURVEY Key insight #7 Eligible applicants are not applying because their personal data is not private. There is some embarrassment about income and asking for any form of help which was a barrier to applying, especially in smaller communities where the applicants are likely to personally know the council staff. There are important cultural attitudes around receiving money and help, and during the research we found evidence of some, but believe there is more. There is currently no visibility of the people who are eligible but choose not to apply for this reason, so further research could be explored in this area. Because there is a legal requirement for the signatures on the statutory declaration, most applicants visit council offices to process the signatures and risk having their details discussed in a public space. Additional data is gathered but not required in the legislation, and lack of clarity of process has led to inconsistent outcomes. The process is open to an individual’s interpretation of the rules, personal decisions and unconscious bias. During the three week Beta online trial there was an enquiry from a potential applicant who wanted to know if the council staff would be able to see their personal information. When discovering that their information would be visible to council staff, they declined to apply. “Anyway, being a much smaller town, more often than not we know those bringing the forms in” COUNCIL STAFF MEMBER “Whilst being appreciative some of them are also embarrassed to have to come in and feel like their financial situation is scrutinised.” COUNCIL STAFF MEMBER “Some people may know about it but not many would share this information with each other because they don’t want to share their income or let people know they are on a low income” APPLICANT Key insight #8 The statutory declaration is a significant barrier to the completion of the process. The current statutory declaration requires the applicant to be physically present at the council office or other stated authority to sign and witness their application. This adds financial cost of travel, stress for those with declining mobility or those who are embarrassed to apply for a benefit style payment in a smaller community. Older customers are more likely to have age onset disabilities that make it difficult for them to get out and about to be able to sign for the Rates Rebate. For those able to drive, finding parking close to council offices can be challenging, as can getting to the council during business hours. There are applicants who are unable to drive and rely on others, or incur the cost of a taxi. Some applicants need a support person with them, and need help with interpreting and understanding the process. Some are unable to walk or stand for long periods of time, housebound or hospitalised. Some applicants are the caregiver for their partner, and they need to arrange additional care for their partner, while they visit the council to sign the form. Some applicants have mental health issues and can only come into Council on a ‘good day’. The good days can take some work, and add to the overall stress for applicants. Some can react and become volatile, and can put the council staff at risk. Some applicants can have high anxiety and can be too scared to leave the house. Council staff often visit applicants at home to allow them to complete the process. Home visits need to accommodate for staff safety, so it takes two staff members out of the council team, and takes out the use of a council vehicle. Councils will often employ extra staff to cover this busy time, but for some councils it’s not practical to do home visits because of the spread over remote outlying areas and small staff numbers. There has been added confusion and rework with the wrong people witnessing (e.g. Real estate agents, family or non CA accountants). “The On-line process is very straightforward, however the requirement to make a declaration in front of a council officer somewhat defeats the on-line process.” ONLINE SURVEY Statutory declaration: Council stories “She got a taxi to drop her to our offices, she got halfway through the doors and needed a chair to rest to catch her breath and rest her legs. Then she made it inside to the counter and sat down while I went through her rebate with her. Then I had to escort her to our cashiers (stopping midway to sit and rest) so she could get some cash out and order her taxi home. It was a big ordeal for her which had her in tears.” “He has a head injury and is very volatile. It depends on the day as to what response you will get when you do a home visit. It takes two staff members to visit him and sometimes he won’t let them in!” “She is bed bound, not just housebound - so the staff have to go in to her bedroom every year. She has to arrange for her home helper to be there when the staff come so it takes a bit of arranging for her and I am sure it is quite intrusive having administration staff from her local Council in her bedroom.” “She is housebound and asks family members who need to coordinate the visit so they can be at the house and explain things to the ratepayer and just be there for reassurance. Often the ratepayer doesn’t really understand what is going on and the disruption to their normal routine and having strangers in their home is very upsetting.” “He is schizophrenic and doesn’t like people so won’t come into the Council building. Staff phone his caregiver and arrange a time and she drives him to the car park and staff go out and witness his signature in the car park.” “She has 6 young with children with medical conditions. It is extremely difficult for her to organise the time to come into the Council to have her application witnessed.” “The elderly are very susceptible to winter illnesses, and yet they often come out of their sick beds and warm houses to sign.” Key insight #9 There is a need for human contact and support. There is a need for the applicants to be able to talk to someone for help, even if the system is automated. Most applicants are comfortable using the phone to make an enquiry, and will use often talk to someone to understand how to navigate the system. Customers often call Council or Citizens Advice Bureau to ask ‘How do I start?’. They want to talk to someone to understand clearly and easily what they need to do. People who are really marginalised and needing help often just need to talk to someone in person. A complex system can be better delivered as an automated process, however automation can also bring gaps and oversights in the system. This can lead to individuals dropping out of the system. Our research surfaced an example of an individual who missed getting a Community Service Card because of an error made through the IRD system miscalculating income. This meant eligibility for other services and support was denied. While the bulk of Rates Rebate applications can be processed with an automated approach, there is still a need for the system to build in human effort for the edge cases or enquiries. The skills of the service centres can adequately provide customers with the support they need. In this way the process can prioritise meaningful human interactions. One of the council service centres is in the process of installing kiosks to support those customers wishing to self serve a transaction. A concierge service directs people to the service they require, and can answer their questions. If they are there for an enquiry they can go talk to one of the staff. If they really want a human to do their transaction for them that’s ok too, they may just need to stand in a queue. The majority of the group have heard about Rates Rebate from friends and family, or through their local council. Applicants often get help from their family, support networks or from council staff to help fill in the form. There are some applicants who enjoy the interaction with the council, and will make an occasion of it, dress up and make a day of it. They enjoy the process if it is a positive one, but get very frustrated if they get the wrong information or need to wait. “Talking to someone about it - so that made me happy” Key insight #10 Recently bereaved need additional help with the application process. Recently bereaved applicants struggle to cope with taking over the household administration if they have not done it previously. Some applicants can find the process daunting and overwhelming in addition to the other tasks left to them to manage. A common scenario is that the applicant has had to care and support their unwell partner, and then is left to cope with the burden of taking over all the household administration tasks. This is also impacted by the grief and upheaval of the considerable change in their life situation. The deceased partner is likely to have previously managed all the finances, household structure and rates administration. Applicants can be confused when trying to apply on their own, but don’t want to take up others time and be a burden. While they are trying to do their best, they struggle to know where to start. There are genuine attempts to comprehend what is needed but they get confused in the process, and need to be supported through the process. Often they will need to learn to drive and will need to gain the confidence to travel independently. “She is a recently widowed lady whose husband used to deal with the rebates and such like. She is not a well woman and rarely leaves the house. She gets quite overwhelmed if she has to deal with bureaucracy so we visit to make it easier for her.” COUNCIL STAFF MEMBER “She came into the offices for her rebate appointment. Her husband had just passed away and she needed the rebate to continue to live in the property. She cried throughout the appointment and was very embarrassed. Her husband did all the finances and she was now having to learn to cope with everything and to pay for everything herself.” COUNCIL STAFF MEMBER “She’s never filled out the application form. Her husband’s always done it” COUNCIL INTERPRETER Key insight #11 Leverage the best channels for awareness and support. One of the biggest barriers to applying is that ratepayers don’t know about Rates Rebates and that they may be eligible. Various channels used by this audience can be leveraged to raise awareness and support the application process. The research identified common groups, organisations and entities that could be used to support information, communication and other assistance for these customers. Spending time with friends and family rated highly, and we also learned that social groups are already are the most common way that people hear about Rates Rebate. Council and Libraries were also identified as effective channels for reaching the target audience. There is also an opportunity to raise awareness through commonly used Gold Card and Community Services Card channels, and during interactions with health professionals and doctors, in local practices and hospitals. Supermarket shopping is a common and frequent activity and may offer additional reach through supplementary advertising. IRD interaction is less frequent, but common across all ratepayers so could offer reminders or additional information. A good proportion of this audience can be reached online through various approaches, especially leveraging social media. “Certainly everyone had heard about it here, and I think it was like a little bushfire that went through” RETIREMENT VILLAGE RESIDENT “I’ve got to go to the doctor on Friday. Last year I was often at the hospital” PRIVATE HOME RESIDENT “Skype and Facepage. Because we talk to Adelaide quite often, and England of course” RETIREMENT VILLAGE RESIDENT Further information and frequency of interactions are available in the Appendix. Appendix #1 Automation feedback The following questions about automation were asked via two online surveys, and during the face to face interviews with applicants. Permission to prefill the application form “And they all moaned because they thought they should just get it and not have to fill it out every year” “Reams of stuff to fill in” Permission to share information from other government agencies “You should know what it is” “The rates office knows all the answers really. They know what we pay and they know what the village pays, so why don’t they just fill it in and I’ll just sign it” Permission to share information from other government agencies There was less interest in sharing information from government agencies, than having the form automatically prefilled based on the previous years application. Some of the reasons why applicants chose ‘No’ to this option were: Previous system errors with agencies had impacted their eligibility for other entitlements Didn’t understand how Ministry Social Development were relevant to them Couldn’t understand how this could be automated Didn’t think Inland Revenue was relevant because they didn’t earn any income Had an accountant so didn’t need input from Inland Revenue Appendix #2 Completing the paper application form As part of the interview process we observed the nine applicants filling in the 2018/2019 Rates Rebate paper application form. We asked them to talk about what they found challenging as they were going through the process. Overall, applicants found the size of the text too small and difficult to read. A lot of information and instruction was skim read but not absorbed. Name (A) First name / Last name fields were often transposed. People automatically wrote their first name in the Last Name field. Title was often overlooked Some were unsure as to which name to use, as they were known by their middle name, or a variation of their name. These names would be different to what the ‘official’ name stated on the Rating Information Database (RID). Address (B) People would start to write their whole address in the first field, then get confused at what they should write in Suburb/Town and postal. A lot of people knew their postcode A lot of people had an email address People were often confused when filling out the question ‘Did you move here from another property during the rating year? If they selected ‘No’, they didn’t realise they could skip the next question ‘If yes, on what date did you settle the sale of your previous property for this rating year?’. They would try and fill out the next questions and get very confused. It would take them a while to figure out that they could have skipped those questions. Retirement village residents sometimes have their own individual street address (number and street name) within the retirement village, but most assumed they could just use the format they would use as a postal address Dependants (C) This question wasn’t relevant for the group we interviewed. They either wrote N/A or put a line through the boxes. However, this information is not legally required by the Act, and its possible that this question may add a barrier to completion. Income Declaration (D) People skim read the instructions, filled in the tick box (New Zealand Superannuation) and then wrote ‘Retired’ in the Occupation field. This is a duplicate of information as there is a NZ Superannuation $ field below, and an addition ‘Occupation’ question on the Stat Dec page. Ideally the repetition could be removed. The format of the ‘Source of income’ fields worked well and there were no issues with understanding where to put the $ amounts. The problem with the income information was that a lot of the applicants didn’t understand that the requirement is for Gross income rather than Net income. People would either guess the amount, or look at their bank account to see what comes in every week/fortnight and do some complex maths to estimate what that would be over a year. There was confusion over the difference between NZ Superannuation and Personal Superannuation. Rates (E) Most people guessed their rates or left the field blank for the council to fill in. People were uncertain of the different types of rates (local, regional, water) Important Information (F) This was skim read by the applicants Declaration (G) Name, Address and Occupation fields are all double up from previous parts of the form. Is there a way to structure this so this data is only written once? ‘Declared at’ caused confusion for a lot of people, as they started to write the date in this field. When they realised their mistake they weren’t sure what the term meant. Most eventually guessed it as ‘place’, but didn’t realise that this was for the authorised witness to fill in. Calculation table (H) This table was often overlooked, but when prompted the applicants found it easy to interpret. Retirement village residents don’t have access to their rates amounts, so are unable to use this table. Appendix #3 Frequently used channels One of the biggest barriers to applying is that ratepayers don’t know about Rates Rebates and that they may be eligible. As part of our research we asked questions to inform how we might better raise awareness. Some of the research surfaced common groups, organisations and entities that could be used to support information, communication and other assistance for these customers. What keeps you busy These channels have been grouped into three sections; ‘Often’, ‘Sometimes’ and ‘Rarely’ to describe the general frequency of interaction with these groups.

The subsidy is delivered by Local Councils and is administered by Central Government (currently the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA)). The entitlement value is calculated by the cost of the rates, applicants income, and number of dependants. The maximum subsidy amount is reviewed yearly. Following a successful (and award winning) Alpha phase in May and September 2018, the Rates Rebate beta trial was run in June and July 2019 by a team with members from Service Delivery and Operations team within DIA, Government Information Services, and the Service Innovation Lab. The Service Innovation Lab invited three councils (Tauranga City Council, Hutt City Council, and Kāpiti Coast District Council) to participate from a larger group that expressed interest. The three councils each run a different IT system for processing applications, providing a good test of any proposed process changes, and a good indication of the challenges of rolling out the solution more widely. Evidence gathered during the beta trial supported the observation during the Alpha phase that an optimised online application form takes just 4 minutes to complete on average, compared to 25 minutes for the paper form. Feedback from councils supported evidence gathered via observation that the online application was considered much easier for applicants to complete. The beta dramatically reduced per-transaction costs for councils, eliminating the need to courier paper applications between councils and the DIA. Councils have communicated their intention to actively promote the online option (if it proceeds beyond beta) based on the improved experience for applicants (and lower processing costs). The statutory declaration remains the single biggest barrier preventing large scale adoption of an online application process (as well as a significant barrier to those applying on paper). Removing the statutory declaration removes the requirement to visit a council to submit an application. A paper was written to support the case for this change during the beta phase. If the case for change is supported, this requirement could be removed by June 2020. Together with the Rates Rebate Beta Research Report, this report documents the key results of the trial, presents options for next steps, and makes a set of recommendations. High-level recommendations A set of recommendations beyond beta are also included later in the document. Run a second trial with the existing three councils during a high application volume period and implement data export solutions A second trial should be run during a high volume period (e.g. August and September) to fully inform DIA and Council decisions about next steps. While running the beta in June meant that council staff were available to collaborate and co-design improvements to the application and process, it also meant that application volumes were lower for councils than they would have been in July and August. Evidence gathered during the Alpha (which ran through the busy period) suggests that uptake of the online option is high when it is promoted by councils (20% of the 800 recipients of a letter sent by Tauranga City Council promoting the online option opted to use it in 2018). The councils involved in the trial have enthusiastically requested that the trial be extended through a high volume period. The second trial should be limited to the same three councils who participated in June/July. This will enable valuable data to be gathered while keeping the cost of the extension minimal. Delay the decision about whether to proceed beyond this extension until the end of this second trial. This will allow time for results from the first round to be validated against higher application volumes. Improvements should be made to how data is transferred between the online application solution and council core systems, and options explored to improve data transfer between council systems and eRMS. The high trust relationship built with the councils involved in the trial should be leveraged to (co)design and implement simple, low cost (but high value) solutions during the trial extension period Options to consider Option 1 - Close down the initiative: inform Councils there will be no change to the current paper-based service from DIA. Decommission the service. Option 2 - Run a second trial with the existing three councils. Continue to provide support, but limit other activity to keep costs minimal. Option 3 - Run a second trial with the existing three councils through a high application volume period and implement data export solutions (recommended): proceed as for option two, but also implement data export solution for councils (for import into their core systems). Investigate (and document a recommendation for) the best solution to improve data submission (reduce cost and reduce/eliminate data entry errors) from council core systems to eRMS. Option 4 - Extend the trial with the existing three councils until the end of June 2020: continue to gradually evolve the service with these councils throughout this period. Use the high quality relationship built with councils to co-design the optimal online (and paper) application process ready for when the statutory declaration requirement is removed. Option 5 - Extend the trial until the end of June 2020 and allow another three councils to join: continue to run the trial with Tauranga City Council, Kāpiti District Council, and Hutt City Council through to June 2020 and trial the service with an additional three councils. Aim to sign up councils that will best test whether the service is ready to be rolled out nationally. Background The Rates Rebates Online Beta was designed to meet the needs of ratepayers, councils, and the DIA Rates Rebates team. It was built based on the findings of a Discovery and Alpha phase. In the Discovery phase we mapped and reviewed the existing Rates Rebates delivery system. We interviewed internal and external stakeholders, and explored potential methods of service delivery. The discovery revealed many opportunities at the system level to improve the experience for both the people applying for their entitlement and people delivering the service. In the Alpha phase, we designed and developed a minimum viable product (MVP), and trialled the product in Tauranga from 21 May—30 September 2018 with Tauranga City Council. The alpha focused on testing system changes. Tauranga City Council, Auckland Council assisted with the design and test of the alpha and numerous other councils watched progress closely. The Alpha proved to be of high value to ratepayers and Councils, and successfully tested a fully digital and user-centred end to end rates rebate process. The source code was released under an Open Source licence (MIT), and the project won the Award for Open Source Use in Government for 2018. In the Beta phase, we focused on further refining the service based on further user research and feedback from ratepayers and councils. We emphasised on ensuring it is was set up to be a live, fully functional, and sustainable system. This included: Learning how the service can scale to more than one council Moving the alpha solution to sustainable production infrastructure and technology Ensuring accessibility, privacy, security issue standards for public services are fully adhered to Gathering feedback from beyond a wider range of councils, beyond just the single council involved in the alpha Building a case for further investment and rule changes Exploring options for future ownership of the service to ensure it will be well managed and continue to evolve if it progresses beyond beta Following research into current user behaviour, the online rates rebate application form was implemented within govt.nz (which is recognised as the authority on rates rebates by major search engines, and referenced by council websites). User acceptance testing (UAT) for the Rates Rebate Beta began on Tuesday 21 May. The Beta trial with ratepayers started on Wednesday 5 June and ended on Monday 1 July. Councils continued to process online applications up to 1 August 2019. Funding for the Beta was approved by the Service Innovation Working Group (SIWG) within the Digital Government Partnership supported by the Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO). To deliver the Beta, a virtual team was created with support and participation from the Service Delivery and Operations (SDO) team (who continue to provide advice and subject matter expertise), and the Government Information Services (GIS) team (who made a significant contribution to the initiative by contributing two developers at high capacity for an extended period). At this stage there has been no funding approved to proceed beyond Beta. Current factors impacting customers using the service Low income, and time poor The current application process is complex, takes a long time, and places an unjustified burden on many people by asking for more information than is necessary. Issues affecting mobility and access The lack of an alternative, accessible way to make an application means many people who have a disability e.g. a vision impairment (over 11% of those over 65) or a physical disability (49% of those over 65 struggle to apply for help they are eligible to receive. The majority of customers are over 65 and/or living with a disability. In the 2017/18 rating year 79% of all applicants were receiving New Zealand Superannuation. The requirement to sign a Statutory Declaration in front of a witness is a barrier for this group. Note: During the Beta trial, a separate paper “Why remove the statutory declaration” was written to support the case for its removal. This paper details the substantial benefits associated with removing the statutory declaration, when this is supported with adoption of an online application process. Applications submitted during the trial We choose to run the beta during the quiet June period directly following the normal “reminder” sent out by councils before the end of the financial year. Councils indicated that this timing would work well because staff would be available to collaborate, co-design, and test improvements to the application and process. This worked well, with the design team able to work closely with both frontline and back office staff to observe processes and current practice. Council staff were also available during a two week period of user acceptance testing, which was important (we had received feedback from Tauranga that insufficient time had been allowed for user acceptance testing in the Alpha). Running the trial in the June period also meant that only a low number of applications were expected to be received and processed (this turned out to be the case). A total of 101 applications were submitted. 46 of the 101 applications were signed and fully processed. 12 were processed by Tauranga City Council 8 were processed by Hutt City Council 26 were processed by Kāpiti District Council 5 of the 101 were submitted, but never signed. 50 of the 101 applications were declined. The most common reason supplied by councils for declining applications was “income too high”. However, there were also a significant number of applications from ratepayers who had already applied in the 18/19 year. The ability to “decline” an application (and supply a reason) was added to the beta, and we believe this feature could provide useful data for analysis (see “Recommendations beyond beta” section later in the document for more about this). Expected benefits We expected the Rates Rebate Beta beta app to help people identify their eligibility and then apply for the rebate with less effort and stress. It was also designed to simplify service delivery for the council from the current very manual and paper-heavy process to a significantly simpler, faster (and digital) service. The trial also further explored how uptake of the scheme could increased. The need to raise awareness of the scheme was identified in the Discovery and Alpha phase, and had recently prompted the DIA to write to the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association, Grey Power and the Citizens Advice Bureau in about eligibility and how to apply. Integration between council and DIA systems was a pain point. We agreed with Service Delivery and Operations that this was not in scope for the trial. In particular, the beta was designed to: Increase the uptake of the Rates Rebate Improve customer experience and satisfaction levels Decrease the cost of processing applications for councils Improve the ability to digitally deliver this and other services to councils Support the case to remove the statutory declaration (witnessed signature requirement) Produce insights informing other use cases with a similar customer profile Evidence supporting expected benefits 1. Increase the uptake of the Rates Rebate** The removal of the statutory declaration requirement for an online application has been clearly identified as the key change needed to increase application volume. Removing the statutory declaration removes the barrier of having to visit a council to submit an application. A paper was written to support the case for this change during the beta phase. If successful, this requirement could be removed by June 2020. All three councils involved in the trial are convinced enabling applications to be completed online will result in a major increase in applications both received and processed. Improvements were made to Rates Rebate content on govt.nz and the calculator based on the analysis of analytics data. These improvements resulted in a significant increase in the number of application form (PDF) downloads. The improvements also resulted in an increase in the number of people receiving an estimate when visiting the calculator (from 47% to 58%). The online application form was optimised to work on mobiles, tablets, and other common devices. The low volume of applications submitted during the trial meant that no meaningful conclusions can be drawn from analysis of analytics data (e.g. percentage of applicants using mobile devices - or, for example, when during the day these applications were filled in). A second trial during a high volume period is recommended to gather more data. The online application form was designed to be a lot simpler than the paper version, which (based on observations by the team and councils) substantially reduced the effort required to complete an application. There is no baseline to compare this to because this isn’t tracked for paper applications (they may be simply discarded). At this stage analytics data measuring conversion hasn’t been processed given the low volumes of applications received during the trial. This will be completed if a further trial is run during a higher volume period. Improvements to the form included: questions reworded questions reordered unnecessary questions and repetition removed in-context help content provided The online application form is much faster to complete, it took on average 4 minutes for customers to complete, versus 25 minutes for the paper form. Again, research indicated this resulted in greater completion rates, but there is no baseline established for paper application forms. Councils are aware that an online application is much faster to complete than a paper application (and much faster for them to process) and they intend to promote this option as a result (if the trial proceeds beyond beta). A great deal of care was taken to ensure the application form is accessible for those with disabilities. This work has been completed with GIS accessibility expert Jason Kiss. With approximately 11% of the target audience vision impaired, and 59% with a disability of some kind, this should not be considered an optional extra (as highlighted in the recently published Digital Inclusion Blueprint). “I’m partially blind, so if things are on a computer I can zoom in and read them” “Sorry, my fingers don’t work very well” “Trouble is I can’t walk very far now. My knees and my ankles have packed up. I can’t drive …because my shoulder’s packed” There was evidence gathered during the trial that even when applicants need to switch channels to apply online, they will do so. Tauranga sent out 800 final reminder letters and had 20% online. As part of the beta trial, email addresses were requested from applicants so that a confirmation email could be sent to confirm their application had been received. These email addresses provide an opportunity to remind applicants to apply in subsequent years. 2. Improve customer experience and satisfaction levels - decrease time, effort and stress** The online application form takes on average 4 minutes to complete, versus 25 minutes for the paper form. This improvement was observed during the Alpha, and supported by observations and analytics during the beta trial. This is a huge improvement which we believe had a huge influence on the overwhelming positive customer feedback gathered by councils (who set up surveys in their offices using existing kiosks, and interviewed applicants). “The people that came in to complete the online process thought it was really good. Clearly an easier process for them” Moira Aplin (Rates Officer, Hutt City Council) While there may be no accepted way of calculating the dollar value of saving 19 minutes for every application filled out, this is a significant time saving for people who we know (from our user research) are time poor - especially if/when it can be realised for a large proportion of the over 95,000 applications submitted annually. We know from user research that ratepayers find the current paper application form confusing. This leads to forms often being completed incorrectly, or required fields left blank. We also know that when this happens, and the problems aren’t picked up at the counter, the applicant must be contacted and the application re-submitted. This delays when the rebate is granted at a time when it’s needed most. Feedback from councils indicated that they experienced fewer of these problems with the application forms they received online. There is still plenty of room for improvement however. The ability to move applications into a “Declined” state (and state a reason) was added based on feedback from councils. A much higher number of applications were moved into this declined state than expected. The most common reasons for declining applications were “applicant had already applied that year” and “applicants income was too high”. This suggests that there is confusion about when to apply. It also suggests (and this was supported by feedback from Tauranga City Council in particular) that there wasn’t enough done in the application process to warn applicants that they may not be eligible based on the information they have supplied before they make the trip to sign their application at a council office. There is more about this in “Recommendations beyond beta” later in this document. 3. Decrease the cost of processing applications for councils Bigger councils currently spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on serving and administering the rebate for rate payers (e.g. Tauranga City Council estimate it costs them $200,000 annually to process 4,500 applications). Even smaller councils like Carterton District Council process 2,000-3,000 applications each year. Councils in the Wairarapa told us they work nights and weekends during the busy period to meet demand - and they believe they currently have very low uptake. They said that “anything to make the experience better” would be a massive help. The Beta has dramatically reduced the cost per transaction costs by: Validating all required fields are filled in Providing guidance and validation messages to ensure the fields are filled in correctly Improving the quality of addresses by suggesting addresses from council rates data Removing the need to manage and review evidence of income documentation Removing the need to review dependant details Automatically filling in rates values and valuation IDs based on council data Removing the need to key in applications from hand-written paper application forms Reducing the time that the double signature step takes by automatically filling in the council staff name, date, and the applicant’s occupation - and capturing signatures digitally Improving the back-office workflow by supporting the ability to easily mark applications as “Processed” and “Batched” Completely removing the need to collate and courier paper applications to DIA Feedback from councils on the improvements made during the beta include: “I can’t emphasise how much better the experience is … the experience is smooth and the QR code is a bit special.” Jeremy Glass (Team Leader: Service Centre, Tauranga City Council) “The speed of the transaction is really noticeable. For example, removing the need for ratepayers to provide evidence of income has made a huge difference.” Jeremy Glass (Team Leader: Service Centre, Tauranga City Council) “Signing of the applications and the processing has all gone smoothly… I’ve really enjoyed not having lots of paperwork on my desk - not having to work out which bits of paper go with which bits of paper… I would love to see this system go ahead.” Moira Aplin (Rates Officer, Hutt City Council) “The look up fields for address worked well and the annual rates amount pulled through to the Council view, so that’s great!” Council back office team “I was buzzing after yesterday’s conference call… [you] have achieved big wins in this phase… Awesome. You have taken the administration of the act back as was originally intended. Not needing proof or collecting unnecessary information is huge for us, and presumably the back office in the rebate team.” Jim Taylor (Manager Transactional Services, Tauranga City Council) “R% said even the signature part is great. She has had applications returned that she signed but had not printed her name, valueless bureaucracy. I love that you are implementing transformational change rather than plastering over the cracks” Jim Taylor (Manager Transactional Services, Tauranga City Council) Based on their experience to date in the Beta trial, Tauranga City Council provided scenarios for the cost savings associated with moving applications online. These scenarios do not include the savings they believe will be realised if/when the statutory declaration requirement is removed. Cost to process: Current state: 4,500 paper applications = $200,000 Approx 45% online: 2,500 paper + 2,000 online applications = $125,000 All online: 4,500 online applications = $75,000 If we assume that the cost per application reduces as the number of applications increases for a given council, then taking Tauranga’s cost per paper application (one of the larger councils) is likely to be conservative = 200,000/4,500 = $44 In Tauranga’s scenario where 45% of applications are completed online, they estimate savings of over $35 per application. Tauranga have also reported that when they sent out 800 reminder letters, they had 20% of applications completed online. If we assume… we can shift 20% of all applications online save $30 in processing cost per application completed online there were many more applications submitted and processed in some way than the 97,510 that were successful in 2017/2018 (as shown in the trial many applications are declined, are duplicates etc) ..then we can conclude that the total savings for all councils nationwide in the first year would be substantially greater than $35 × 97,510 × 20% = $682,570. This number would be expected to increase as the proportion of applicants applying online increases. 4. Improve the ability to digitally deliver this and other services to councils One of the most important questions that the Beta phase set out to answer was “will councils even agree to participate in a beta trial”, given their participation involved a significant amount of time and effort on their part. The response we received from the councils we invited/pitched to participate was overwhelmingly positive. In fact, demand to participate in the Beta trial far exceeded expectations, and some councils were informed that they would need to wait to see if there was a subsequent Beta phase. Representatives from all three councils are so enthusiastic about the results of the trial that they are keen to get an opportunity to personally (face to face) provide their feedback on the trial to Rates Rebate decision makers. A high trust relationship has been built with the councils involved in the trial, with really positive feedback from all three councils (see #3 above). As part of the trial, digital tools such as Trello and Slack were introduced to council staff. These tools enabled transparent and swift communication throughout the trial, and also encouraged communication between councils. The trial involved the council experiencing rapid cycles of development and feedback which could from the basis for other similar engagements with those councils. The virtual team model where a team was formed from SDO, GIS, and the Service Innovation Lab proved to be a highly effective mechanism to rapidly improve a service. The combination of subject (service) matter expertise, digital channel expertise (and access + control of the channel/platform), and service design meant implementation was extremely efficient. 5. Support the case to remove the statutory declaration (witnessed signature requirement) A paper was written to support the case for this change during the beta phase. A summary of the key points is included here. Applying for a rates rebate currently involves making a statutory declaration. The requirement to have applicants have their signature witnessed to complete a rates rebate application means that they are unable to submit an application without travelling either to a council office, or organising an alternative witness, such as a JP. The need to travel necessitated by the statutory declaration has been identified as the biggest single barrier preventing large scale adoption of an online application process. It is also considered the biggest hurdle for those submitting paper based applications. While this step may seem a minor inconvenience for those who live or work close to a council office, and who are mobile, it is a major barrier for those in more remote locations, or those who are less mobile, such as the disabled and the elderly. It is likely that these are some of the most disadvantaged in our communities. Removal of the statutory declaration, and adoption of the online application process will… remove a substantial cost and inconvenience barrier for those who don’t live near a council office enable people who are actually unable to travel to council offices to still apply for a rebate allow the process to scale beyond the availability and capacity of council staff to witness signatures and support paper based applications significantly reduce the costs of administering the scheme through the removal of manual tasks support improvements to privacy within the application process. It is not practical to control or record who views information provided on paper. When applications are made online, there are opportunities to remove and/or audit council staff access to private information supplied in the application. 6. Produce insights informing other use cases with a similar customer profile The Beta phase was focused on further refining the Alpha service based on further user research and feedback from ratepayers and three councils. The Rates Rebate Research Report documents insights from research based on a combination of customer interviews, council and stakeholder observations and conversations, online surveys and analytics analysis. The key insights from this report are: The system is too complex and multiple errors are occuring Seniors are more digitally capable than many assume Applicants are relinquishing control over to the council and authorities The current process is not accessible to people with disabilities Retirement village residents were well supported and have wrap around services There is a significant appetite for various forms of automation Eligible applicants are not applying because their personal data is not private The statutory declaration is a significant barrier to the completion of the process There is a need for human contact and support Newly bereaved need additional help with the application process Leverage the best channels for awareness and support Many of these insights inform other use cases with a similar customer profiles. Rates Rebate is just one example of a service used by seniors. Two examples of insights which inform services beyond Rates Rebate are: Seniors are more digitally capable than many assume Many superannuitants are using websites and apps to achieve a wide range of tasks. Three quarters of the superannuitants interviewed are interacting online and are digitally savvy. Facebook, Skype and emails are commonly used to connect friends and family. A large proportion use these applications for video calling, sharing photos, and sending messages. The current process is not accessible to people with disabilities The applicants interviewed all used reading glasses and struggled to read the smaller text on the paper application form. If the application form is accessed as a downloadable pdf, it’s possible to enlarge the text, but the content doesn’t reflow into the screen, therefore comprehension is compromised. The downloadable pdf hasn’t been tagged with appropriate markup labels, therefore is not accessible to those using screen reader technology. Recommendations beyond beta Based on what was learned during the beta trial, we recommend the following areas be explored further: Consider a substantial redesign of the paper application form and/or alternative ways to apply. Ratepayers find the current paper application form confusing. This leads to forms often being completed incorrectly, or required fields left blank. Applicants often perceive the ‘rates’ and ‘income’ step as easy, yet will frequently get this information wrong. Accessibility is also a real problem. All of the applicants interviewed during or research used reading glasses and struggled to read the smaller text on the paper application form. There is more information about this in the Rates Rebate Beta Research Report (key insight #1 and #4 - with detail in Appendix 2). Ensure councils understand their role in the application process, in particular with respect to the declaration and income. Research conducted during the beta trial found there is a lack of clarity around the role council staff have in authenticating the proof of income. This can mean that the responsibility of verification frequently falls to the council staff member, rather than the ownership of the declaration staying with the applicant. The beta trial tested the removal of the need to supply evidence of income. This reduced the level of effort required by councils to process some applications. It also made it very clear whose responsibility it was to ensure the declaration of income was correct. We saw evidence during the trial which suggested that application details (including) were regularly being updated after declarations were being signed. This is clearly not good practice. There is more information about this in the Rates Rebate Beta Research Report (key insight #3). Explore how the application forms might be pre-filled based on previous applications. Results from surveys (29 of 33 respondents) and interviews indicate that the majority of applicants would prefer to have the form prefilled based on their previous application. Eligible ratepayers are surprised that they are required to fill in the form manually every year. This perplexes a lot of people as they find repeating the process of getting the information from separate government authorities inefficient and a waste of time. People’s circumstances don’t generally change each year, yet the same information is required every rating year. There is more information about this in the Rates Rebate Beta Research Report (key insight #6). Conduct further research during the 19/20 rating year into how well the application process is working for retirement village residents. Our research found that the experience of village residents who had applied in 18/19 was very positive, but we believe this is because local councils provided a high level of support in the first year, which is unlikely to be the case from the second year onwards. There is more information about this in the Rates Rebate Beta Research Report (key insight #5). Leverage the high trust relationship built with the three councils involved in the trial to (co)design and implement simple, low cost (but high value) solutions. These include: a. Providing data exports for online applications which can be imported into council systems. During the trial a basic example was implemented to solicit feedback from councils, but there wasn’t sufficient time to refine the solution. b. Explore how to best extend the solution to support applicants who live in retirement villages. A decision was made during the beta to focus on optimising the process for the majority of applicants, and not attempt to support retirement villages. A solution for retirement village residents (and in particular providing a solution to allow village administrators to submit the additional supplementary information) was explored during the trial, and is not expected to be particularly hard to fully design and implement. c. Design a solution which provides guidance about the rebate the applicant can expect as part of the application process (rather than requiring applicants to use the calculator first). An estimated value of the rebate likely to be received was removed from the alpha after feedback from councils suggested that the majority of applicants entered either their rates or their income values incorrectly, and may be put off completing their application if they saw an incorrect estimate displayed. Tauranga believe that this led to a number of unnecessary visits by applicants who were not eligible. We believe it is possible to design a solution which carefully communicates the rebate is an estimate - not putting off those struggling to get the figures correct from seeking help, but also preventing unnecessary trips by those clearly not eligible. d. Explore other small changes which will reduce back office processing effort for councils. Kāpiti were unable to process online applications together with paper applications during the trial which required additional management effort. Improve the “Decline” feature in the application which allows applications to be put in “declined” state (and stores a reason why the application was declined). This simple feature could be easily enhanced to suggest a list of common reasons applications are rejected when councils reject applications. This would then facilitate easy analysis of this data by SDO. Explore the value that could be provided by implementing a simple dashboard that gives senior council staff an overview of how many applications are at which stage of the workflow. Also explore whether providing this information to DIA, and an additional view across all councils would be valuable. During the beta there was evidence to suggest that many problems occured in the paper process when applications were not processed in a timely fashion. The ability to monitor the workflow was highlighted by both councils and SDO as a desirable feature. Implement improvements to the layout of the application batch files provided for DIA by the beta application. While there were a number of refinements made to the batch file format based on feedback from the Service Delivery and Operations team, there are a simple improvements (such as better support for double sided printing) which could be easily implemented and make a big difference. Replace the need to print and file paper copies of applications for 7 years with a digital alternative. In the beta trial a solution was implemented which created application batch files which could be printed by Service Delivery and Operations direct from the secure application. This achieved the goal of avoiding the need for councils to print and then courier these batch files, while minimising any impact on the SDO team. There is an opportunity to explore existing digital solutions within DIA/government which meet the 7 year requirement for storage. Implement a solution that supports the rejection of applications which have already been lodged in eRMS. The process for paper applications currently involves rejecting a claim in eRMS, and then returning the form to the council to have the application amended, resigned, and submitted in a new batch. The equivalent process has not yet been implemented in the beta. Explore whether introducing rules-based auditing (in addition to the current audit process) would make the process more robust. In the beta applicants weren’t required to supply evidence of income. If they declared income under $5,000 they were asked to supply a reason. Rules/triggers (e.g. declared less than $5,000 income) which prompt further information to be requested in certain cases may be an opportunity to make the process more robust while keeping most applications lean. Measure the improvements to the DIA part of the process as a result of a move from paper on online applications. Explore further opportunities to reduce costs. Improvements to data quality through the elimination of errors when interpreting handwriting, and during keying in applications, will reduce issues for DIA as well as councils. Reducing the number of applications couriered should also reduce effort. Greater visibility of council workflows is likely to increase the ability to capacity plan, and reduce peaks and troughs. This value should be measured, and optimised. Work with Inland Revenue and Ministry of Social Development to allow for consented income testing to make it easier for applicants to prove their income. Despite applicants often perceiving the ‘rates’ and ‘income’ step as easy, it is known that they frequently get this information wrong. The beta used rates information supplied by councils to remove errors with rates information, this left income as the major pain point. Work with other agencies such as Ministry of Social Development to integrate the rates rebate application into applications for other services. The product owner of MyMSD was engaged during the beta trial and there was interest in working together to paper prototype potential solutions. Translate the online application form into other languages, and provide the option online to choose a language. Councils identified that they had applicants who had low levels of fluency in English and found applying difficult. It was common for the council teams to find a workmate who spoke the language and could deal with these applications, and also for these staff to move on leaving the teams unable to deal with applicants with low English fluency."},{"title":"About the Service Innovation Lab","url":"/about/","tags":[],"body":"Our Story People at the heart of innovation Government agencies working together and really listening to people – from the vulnerable to the tech-savvy – to redesign their services to better meet the needs of all New Zealanders. A pipedream? From 2016 to mid-2020, the Service Innovation Team had a crack at something quite unique: it explored working across Government agencies, setting out to discover what it would take to get agencies to work more collaboratively. Digital change was presenting more efficient ways of working - both challenging and providing opportunities - to Government agencies to deliver more joined-up services. The Team comprised service designers, software developers and skilled support staff, whose diverse work was overseen by senior officials across Government. It collaborated with other agencies, private partners and community groups. Together they made a point of listening to citizens to understand their ‘pain points’ when using, or trying to use, government’s often overly-complex services. Work took place in a neutral space no single agency owned, known simply as ‘the Lab’. Here, agencies could step away from business-as-usual mindsets and were encouraged to work and think differently. The hope was they would share what they’d learnt and build capability within their own agencies. Lab team at the 2018 All of Government Showcase event, Wellington Guests were provided specialist skills and support to build tools such as financial calculators, develop award-winning open-source code and reusable componentry, a VR tool for policy-makers, and to streamline and digitise services so they were easier to access and deliver. The Lab team ran hui that invited ‘different voices to the table’. They tested and refined ways to make it easier for people to get financial benefits they were entitled to, such as a Rates Rebate and Community Services Card. Internationally significant work on Legislation as Code and Better Rules was undertaken early in the Lab. The Team sought to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Many took weekly te reo lessons, learnt their pepeha, several waiata and became more familiar with Tikanga Māori. Visitors or manuhiri, were welcomed with a whakatau. One Discovery that explored renting a property spun into a second - examining the concept of kainga: ‘property’ for Māori is a significantly different cultural concept. While whānau pani, integral to the Māori approach to death and grief, laid a powerful foundation for the Whetūrangitia infant death support service to build upon. The work was innovative and experimental. That meant sometimes it went up blind alleys and other times discovered precious nuggets it wasn’t even searching for. When the physical facility closed, some work ended and others transitioned to lead agencies to progress. The team packaged up its body of work into this Toolkit. Guides and templates were created, along with an attempt to articulate the valuable ‘Lab Approach’ that had developed over time. This approach drew international interest, attracting visitors from Asia, Canada, the UK, USA, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Often valuable research undertaken by government (and beyond) is archived or not easily discoverable and therefore investment in such work is not available to build on or inform others who could benefit. Valuable work has been undertaken in the Lab. Some of this has been large and impactful; some small, yet incremental in contributing to a bigger change that benefits New Zealanders. As such, the Toolkit represents a repository of immense value. In the end, the team says its biggest lesson from everything that went well, was that this happened when effort was focused right at the start on establishing enduring relationships and then building trust – something Māori would capture in the saying he tangata he tangata he tangata; it is about the people, the people, the people.

Project-specific insights are also available in the project summaries shared in the projects section. 1. The importance of innovation leadership and governance to sustaining delivering and implementation There was a clear pattern that when the governance conditions were positive, it led to collective ownership of the Lab’s work programme and a more robust mandate focused on delivery. The governance and leadership of innovation work is essential for a supportive authorising environment, especially when focusing on cross-government collaboration. But there is a tension between the focus placed on training people in innovation processes and methods and the importance of also investing in growing capacity and capability to govern and lead innovation work in the public sector. This is reinforced by uncertain system-level incentives for collective ownership and accountability. How might we… Create the conditions inside government that encourage people to explore new ways of working and safe to fail experimentation? Better understand the distinction between governance and commissioning for innovation versus BAU? 2. The importance of working in the spaces in-between agencies A focus on joined-up working has placed a premium on a culture of collaboration between agencies. It required dedicated engagement roles in the team focused on building relationships, trust and joining the dots between teams and strategic priorities that otherwise would not connect. Through a focus on integrated services, the Lab helped to join the dots but also offered expertise, resources and space to help make it happen. But this catalytic role is crucial to fostering cross-agency working but often difficult to measure, quantify and articulate to sponsors. How might we… Recognise the value and invest in capacity and capability to work between teams and agencies to catalyse collaborative relationships and trust? Best measure and articulate the value of this function? 3. It’s not about the lab space, but everyone seems to value the space For people who worked with the Lab the concept of a dedicated (neutral) space was regularly cited as important - offering a physical space in which to collaborate, engage and work in an agile and adaptive way. Working remotely during the COVID-19 lockdown, highlighting that creative and participative approaches are possible digitally. Despite this, the lab space played an important role in the Lab’s work and identity and was different from a typical office. But rather than focus on labs, the more pertinent question may be why aren’t the characteristics of lab spaces, not the norm and where they do exist, why are they so scarce? Teams are increasingly being asked to work more collaboratively, creatively and to adopt agile practices but current workspaces don’t mirror the qualities people say they valued in the Service Innovation Lab or similar spaces. How might we… Shift the focus from how innovation labs are designed to how we create workspaces that meet the needs of work people are asked to do? Why are they so scarce? Apply the principles and practice of innovation labs into new settings without the need for formal/physical lab infrastructure? 4. Joined up working by design A focus on ‘life events’ and integrated services established a work programme that required collaboration by default. As no single agency was responsible for every aspect of a life event, it needed teams to work together and recognise their interdependence. More importantly, it put the lived experience of people at the centre or the work. But arranging government around life events with current structures presents challenges, and competing priorities creates fragility. Agency priorities can also override shared priorities. It requires people to look beyond their own agency boundaries, resources and accountabilities. How might we… Develop work programmes, processes and structures that foster collaboration and joined-up working by design? What would it take? Create a more influential and more visible role for people/service users in policy development, implementation and delivery? 5. The precariousness of funding for new ways of working holds us back The system-level conditions (resources, ownership, authority) for innovation work are persistently precarious and often short term for projects and labs/innovation teams. While this can be a helpful driver for innovation, in a public sector context innovation work is often grappling with complex long-term issues. But short term funding cycles often leads to time and effort being diverted towards justifying continued support and funding and away from the work itself. It can create pressures to focus on quick wins and justifying the work, over system-level change and a longer-term focus. How might we… Develop approaches to funding and resourcing labs and innovation teams that incentivise long term thinking and outcomes? Better demonstrate value and impact in the short term that supports a long term approach?"},{"title":"Service Innovation Lab journey","url":"/insights/lab-journey/","tags":[],"body":"Lab Journey - snapshot While the lab’s principles stayed consistent how it operated and where it focused evolved. Some of this was guided by the team adapting and iterating based on hands on experience and learning. Other times it was shaped by the wider environment including changes to the authorising environoment, funding, a change of government and practical challenges like the need to move offices three times. A important reflection is the importance of the ability change, adapt and anticipate is key to the sustainability of labs. We have loosely framed this around four key phases below. This includes the final period of transistion and closure of the lab. Phase 1 - Lab as a space (Feb - Jun 2017) The Service Innovation Lab was a 5-month experiment, which ran from February to June 2017. It was co-designed and co-delivered by the Service Innovation Work Programme team in the Department of Internal Affairs, in partnership with Assurity Consulting Ltd along with support and direction from the Service Innovation Reference Group. It provided a place where teams from different agencies, NGOs, private sector and New Zealanders could a physical space conducive to collaboration and experimentation, supported by skilled lean and agile coaches to help teams rapidly evolve their working methods. Features Lab as a space (based inside of government) External expertise (procured) Time-limited Senior Support and mandate Cross-government focus Prototyping new ways of working across government Landscape Established public service reform agenda (Better Public Services) Increased expectation that agencies will collaborate and work in joined-up ways Increased interest in human-centred approaches across government Importance of digital services and digital identity amplified Phase 2 - Lab as a service (July 2017 to Jun 2018) Building on the lab as a space concept, Lab Plus extended the offer beyond a space to include an in house service to agencies. It focused on life-events and integrated services with a digital focus. A work programme and further funding was approved by the lab’s cross-government governance group. This iteration brought together staff from across government to work on a new way of delivering government services. A number of key projects progressed to implementation. Other pieces laid foundations and secured buy-in for further work. Several barriers also began to emerge which were presented to sponsors. Features Increased internal capability and expertise within the lab team (reduced reliance on external expertise) 12-month work programme Focus on life events and integrated services as catalyst for cross-government working Senior support and resources committed Landscape General election and change of government - Oct 2017 New government’s 100-day plan took priority over lab work for partner agencies Team required to move offices three times in 12 months - once post-earthquake Dedicated lab space established (close to partner agencies) Phase 3 - Lab as a space and a service (Jun 18 - Jun 20) This phase sought to embed work to make it easier for people to access / use government services. The lab offered both a physical space and a multi-disciplinary team building onthe previous18 months experience innovating inside government. For those teams working closely with the lab team, the relationship became increasingly valued for the capability uplift opportunity it offered plus ad-hoc connections with other government teams. It was also a period of uncertainty. With resources, work programme alignment and an uncertain authorising environment leading to flux in the lab’s role and higher turnover in staff. Work on integrated services continued but some of the barriers to collaboration identified in phase 2 persisted. Features Lab as a dedicated neutral space (based outside of government) increasingly popular Work supplemented by future-thinking e.g. Emerging Tech workstream Increased profile - lab hosted international visitors (with NZTE) Increased range of expertise in team but also higher turnover of staff Landscape New government priorities around wellbeing and digital became more established Uncertainty about lab funding and future viability Continued demand and interest in human-centred approaches across government Wellington based alternatives emerged as other innovation partners for agencies Phase 4 - Lab close and transition (Oct 19 - Jun 20) In late 2019, DIA announced it was closing closethe lab and this would happen by 30 June, 2020. The decision was part of the move to explore system-wide delivery of integrated services, addressing significant barriers the lab had faced in terms of funding structures and the single-agency approach.. Much of the work programme transitioned to the relevant lead agencies and DIA’sDigital Public Service branch aimed to continue a level of support to agencies that did not have in-house service designers. It also started exploring, with other agencies, a better approach to delivering integrated services at a system level.. The transition period coincided with the arrival of Covid-19 in early 2020. The wider government response and need to work remotely under Alert Level 3 and 4 enabled the lab to help other teams by sharing its experience of agile and digital collaborative practice, while also continuing to deliver itswork programme. Features Developing of lab toolkit and sharing approach Re-emergence of earlier discovery work Focus on integrated services Cross department support during response to COVID-19 Landscape Restructure and changes in home agency Managing transition of lab work programme to new host teams Early stages of COVID-19 and preparation for Level 3 and 4 Shift to remote working with focus on online collaborative working"},{"title":"Practical tips on running a lab","url":"/insights/lab-tips/","tags":[],"body":"Overview Over past three and half years the team has gained hands on experience starting, developing, running and closing a lab. Below are eight practical areas and questions to explore that the team has identified. They are not intended to cover every aspect of running a lab and we have highlighted other useful lab resources too. 1. Establishing team culture and mindsets Lab team reflections An open and inclusive team culture is critical for success, creating the foundations for wider project work Embracing Te Reo Māori and Te Ao Māori is non-negotiable Co-locating with other team encourages modelling of positive team culture and practices Confidence and capability to give and receive feedback enhances team culture, but requires trust Questions to explore Would your team culture feel welcoming and inclusive to people outside the team? In practice, how well does your team culture reflection team principles? If there’s a disconnect - why? How does your team’s culture compare to the rest of the organisation? What issues or opportunities does this create? 2. Practices, routines and rhythms that support creativity Lab team reflections Predictable routines support ‘tight and loose’ working. Tight work supports work programme coherence Agile methods can help quickly triage, prioritise the work programme, staying focused on the core purpose A critical operational role includes someone being responsible for establishing and running team processes (aka scrum master) It’s essential that everyone commits to the team’s customs and routines to support workflow and shared learning Questions to explore What will the work programme look like and who is responsible for managing it? What criteria will you use for accepting and prioritising new work or stopping existing work? Do the team’s practices and routines support remote working? 3. A physical space is not essential but can be an attractor Lab team reflections An open-door policy for visitors and working is a default and supports engagement and knowledge sharing A neutral space can support cross-agency work and encourage collaboration by tacitly removing perceptions of ownership Hosting visitors is an opportunity to model how you work - showing not telling A dedicated space is helpful but not essential, and it’s difficult for it to be the primary offer of a lab team. Questions to explore How easy is it for people to access and make use of the lab space? How effectively are you using the lab space to tell the story of your work? What would a virtual lab offer? How would you make it work? 4. Relationship & engagement require dedicated focus - they are not an add on Lab team reflections Experience of government processes can help bring understanding of system-level barriers. External relationships and champions can offer validation and credible support. Building relationships at multiple levels with people who can support the work is essential. Relationships across the team are just as important and external relationships for reducing silos. Questions to explore Whose role is to develop and hold relationships? How is this relational capital shared across the team? What do reciprocal relationships look like for your work? 5. Positive relationships with friendly people working in corporate support functions (eg property, IT and procurement) can help when pushing at the edges of BAU Lab team reflections A standard set of online tools supports collaboration and information sharing. When absent, it causes delays and frustration. Building relationships with lead contacts in corporate property and procurement helps to progress non-BAU requests Operating a panel of external providers can support flexible procurement of additional expertise when needed Questions to explore Are the tools used in the labs accessible to other government teams? When using cloud-based tools how confident are you that personal data is protected? Who is responsible for building relationships with key corporate teams like procurement and finance? 6. Capability uplift when it’s not your core purpose Lab team reflections Even if not a primary goal, labs can contribute to growing new capability can capacity through their work Be clear about what capability uplift goals are and how they can be measured Growing internal capability and experience of staff helps reduce reliance on external expertise and consultants Start where people are at. Understand the context and needs of the teams you’re working with Questions to explore What capabilities and skills are you seeking to grow? Is the team best placed to do this? What specialist capabilities are best provided externally? How can you effectively measure the impact of a capability building work? 7. Skills and experiences valuable to a lab team Lab team reflections People who can operate across and in between teams helps to build relationships and access institutional knowledge A studio manager role in overseeing the space and key relationships is crucial For cross-government work focused on complex challenges an inter-disciplinary team supports responsive and adaptive working Clear roles and responsibilities are essential but so is an appetite for learning from others Questions to explore How will you help Knowledge sharing opportunities across a team with diverse skills? What capability building offer is of most use to people outside the lab? How does a focus on capability building align with the purpose of the team? 8. Funding and resourcing Lab team reflections Funding is often short term and precarious, which impacts on sustainability. A medium to long term strategy around funding is important. A shared funding approach with a range of partners can help mitigate the risk of a single funder backing out Available resources need to align with your intent and the expectations from funders about what success looks like (especially in the short term) Questions to explore What would it look like to start small and work differently with the resources you already have? What does a long term approach look like when short-term funding is the norm? How will you build trust and demonstrate to sponsors that the lab’s work is delivering value?"},{"title":"APIs for Service Innovation","url":"/projects/api-for-service-innovation/","tags":[],"body":""},{"title":"Component Library","url":"/projects/component-library/","tags":[],"body":""},{"title":"Family Services Directory API","url":"/projects/msd-family-services-directory-api/","tags":[],"body":""},{"title":"Open Fisca Aotearoa","url":"/projects/open-fisca-aotearoa/","tags":[],"body":""},{"title":"RapuTure","url":"/projects/rapuTure/","tags":[],"body":""},{"title":"20 Year Emerging Technology Landscape","url":"/projects/20-year-emtech-landscape/","tags":[],"body":"Led by Dr Hazel Bradshaw, Emerging Tech Lead - Service Innovation Lab Overview Emerging technologies are set to disrupt a number of government processes and services, alongside citizens engagement with government and the services they offer. The EmTech 20-year landscape was intended to be a piece of ongoing research intended to help people working in government understand the types, forms, connections and impacts of these different technologies and the challenges and opportunities they pose. Creating and offering people this constantly evolving landscape equips them with a better understanding of how emerging technologies might impact their work, and to use this to inform their decision-making. The diagram displays a time scale of “current”, “0 to 5 years”, “5 to 10 years” and “10 to 20 years” on the vertical axis and 13 categories of emerging technology along the horizontal access. The 13 categories of emerging technology are: cloud computing, big data/analytics, encryption/privacy, internet of things, spatial computing, artificial intelligence tools, artificial intelligence applications, robotics/production, autonomous agents, symbiotic application, bio-tech and quantum computing. Categories are laid out from left to right, with cloud computing being furthest left, and quantum computing being furthest right. The cards underneath each category display the specific technology which falls under the category listed in one of the 13 columns. It is worth noting this landscape projects details up to the use and release of Quantum Computing, as the possibilities of this technology being ubiquitously used will more than likely change the entire landscape. How the Landscape was constructed The selected technologies and their positioning on the landscape was informed by research, and shaped by consultation with other emerging tech leaders. It was constructed by applying a governmental lens which aimed to enable a better digital public service. These sources include: OECD World Economic Forum McKinsey Institute Gartner - Hype Cycle SAP AIForum New Zealand Technology to focus on With such a vast array of technology in the landscape, the lab identified seven key areas of technology that should be given a high priority focus. Artificial Intelligence Spatial Computing Encryption Internet of Things Big Data Robotics and Autonomous Systems Quantum Computing Opportunities for Further Work This work has the potential to be expanded and developed. Possible future work could be: Application of different lenses Applying different lenses onto this landscape will most likely see the landscape change. An example of another lens would be that of digital inclusion, which would identify technology that could ensure a more equitable digital environment. Workshops with external partners To help broaden the technologies represented in the landscape, engaging with other government agencies and various private sector organisations to shed light on the developing trends within New Zealand. Landscape visualisation development The landscape could be made interactive and more interconnected. The landscape cards could be made interactive so they display definitions of the technology when clicked on.. More work could also be undertaken to develop a visualisation of the connections to show dependencies between the different technologies. Primer per category A primer template has been created and an example AI Primer can be found in the resources. A primer can be utilised to further explain the categories at the top of the landscape in relation to what it is, examples of it and other details listed in the template. Disruption Further work could be done to investigate and therefore understand how disruptive the emerging technologies listed in the landscape are likely to be to the current environment. This should be visualised on the landscape itself, integrating disruption into the Primer.

Often when developing integrated services and supporting agencies that are working together, there’s a problem or issue that has been looked at many times but not progressed to any action. There will be many reasons why it hasn’t moved. In some cases, while a solution can be hypothesised, the system or technology may not have been mature enough. In other cases, the overwhelming body of information becomes paralysing and it is difficult to define what the next step should be. Often there can be many options, but people begin focusing too much on choosing the right place to start - when they should just get started. The great thing about the integrated services work is that this requires agencies to work collaboratively to define a way forward. A collective of dedicated, committed people from across agencies often finds a mechanism to progress things that an agency by itself struggles to get traction with. Recently, with our work around Feijoa, the team of agencies working to support people to enrol in services has been able to create a small digital test, that has stimulated and focused discussion in a way that more technical papers could not. Over five months in 2019, the Lab started exploring consent based information sharing in combination with several other agencies and groups, both in and out of government. Consent based information sharing is a key component in allowing people to access services or benefits from government they are entitled to. The rules of information sharing and privacy under which the New Zealand Government works means it is not always appropriate for agencies to share information about people with each other. This is a protection to ensure people’s information is only used for the reasons and purpose for which it was provided. However, this can mean people must repeatedly provide the same information to different agencies to apply for or access a specific service. This is particularly difficult where several agencies must work together in determining eligibility for the service and each of them should be satisfied the criteria is met. It can also mean sometimes people who are entitled to a benefit or a service from government are not aware they qualify, even though sufficient information exists inside government to automatically enrol them. Resolving this type of issue is one of the key deliverables to enable Integrated Services related to Life Events. One potential approach to resolving this is to allow people to manage the information related to them and be able to control when and with whom it is shared. The Lab has been exploring such consent-based information sharing in a project it has called ‘Feijoa’. Feijoa provides a working example of how a consent based information sharing tool could work. It would allow a person to have control over the release of the information that government requires and be able to provide it in a verified accessible form. Feijoa, at this stage is only a Minimum Likeable Product, possibly a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is built to support the Use Case of a parent enrolling their child in an Early Learning Service (ELS). Research undertaken for the Life Event related to the birth of a child (SmartStart) had started to identify pain points for parents and caregivers with young children, particularly as they navigate future choices that impact their child and the whanau (family) around them. Choosing and enrolling in an Early Learning Services was identified as a key concern for parents of young children - becoming concerned when the child was still very young .These parents were often grappling with balancing their understanding of the options, the potential impact of their choices and the daily process of supporting and bringing up this new young person. All the elements that would be consistent with people dealing with the complexities of dealing with government, at the very time that events in their life make them less able to do this. By placing an example of a potential service into the discussion it was possible to: Speed up the process of discovery –pre-discovery identified there were a lot of papers written on the subject of consent based information sharing. Existing research by government and others focused on ways to support people to control and manage their digital information. However, many of these had created ambiguity and some confusion in people’s thinking. As we listened to people talk and read what was produced, we realised they often used the same term for different things, or different terms for the same thing. We thought presenting people with a specific, tangible tool could clarify the conversation. Clarify the practical implications of the privacy rules and look at ways of enshrining their intent in the service approach. The New Zealand privacy rules do not allow government to collectively hold and share some information, and in some cases people need to look after and provide this information themselves. A classic example: the number of times people are asked to produce a birth certificate to complete different transactions. The privacy rules allow for some sharing, under tight scrutiny, and government is working on how to best enable this and remain aligned to the intent and rules related to privacy. Move past a locked discussion around what to do next, largely created by trying to solve the whole problem in one step instead of utilising the power of micro services. Micros services provide the potential to build an interconnected bed of solutions each of which is solving part of the sharing, and later the delegation issue. These can then be combined in the right way around any single service, making the components completely reusable. As we move forward with this discovery we will keep you posted. Early discussion is already raising key questions, such as: Who could own and manage such a service, can a government entity under the control of a single agency do it? What are the impacts on current practice and the legislation guiding this? How will those using such a service view it. Is it really valuable to them? The next stage is to fully socialise the concept; having a working model has certainly helped that. *To answer the question lots of people have asked about the name. We choose names (or short titles) for our work that deliberately have no association with the actual subject matter. Often based on what one of the team had for breakfast or a favourite food. By doing this we remove potential preconceived ideas from predetermining the discussion. With Feijoa, we found lots of people were using the same terms to describe different things, or different terms to describe the same thing. Calling it Feijoa meant we all had to understand it as a new thing, and then see it for what it is, rather than leaping in with what someone thought it might be….

COVID-19’s arrival in New Zealand in March 2020 coincided with preparations for the Lab’s June closure. The decision to close followed the formation of the Digital Public Service branch within the Department of Internal Affairs, which had provided secretariat services and oversight of what was otherwise an all-of-Government facility. Formation of the DPS branch was to ensure DIA had an operational structure to enable it to deliver on the Government’s new Strategy for a Digital Public Service. One of the lessons learned in the Lab while working with agencies to deliver integrated services, was that a way to accelerate delivery of integrated services without the significant barriers of single-agency governance and funding structures was required. The DPS branch is now talking with other agencies about how to address these challenges at a system-wide level. The learnings, tools and innovative ways of working that the Lab had prototyped look likely to be harnessed for whatever mechanism is eventually decided. The DPS Branch continues to support agencies who don’t have in-house service designers and will facilitate the development of integrated services where possible. Other DPS staff will help agencies develop their digital strategies, investment plans and work through privacy considerations. Approaching June 30, the Lab’s in-flight work was transitioned to the agencies leading each piece. Some of the team were able to continue their work within DIA. The remaining work stopped. As COVID hit, the Lab team continued its work but was still able to add extra value… Pivoting the team’s skills - and doing some heavy lifting Team members who had already transitioned into the DPS when lockdown occurred moved quickly to provide support and coaching to managers and teams. They introduced workflow management tools such as Trello that enabled work to occur more iteratively and gave staff skills to better prioritise tasks that were streaming in from across government. Staff still based in the Lab, but working from home, continued with the Integrated Services Work Programme to ensure this didn’t get dropped during the transition period or by the disruption caused by COVID. To a certain degree, activity also became anticipatory. Team members looked ahead to what might be needed. Adapting re-usable componentry Staff who had previously collaborated with DIA’s Service Delivery and Operations on a financial calculator for SmartStart, took this reusable component and adapted it for the COVID response. Within five days they had a calculator that employers, employees and the self-employed could easily use to work out their new financial entitlements.It took nearly four weeks to go through a bottle-necked Government COVID response review process before release, but quickly proved its worth: within five days it was receiving an average 2,122 page views per day. Responding with technology for a ‘touchless’ future - Korerorero As with the calculator, other work that began in anticipation of future need was the quick-build of the Korerorero framework. This runs a chatbot called Quinn, using what was learnt from Police with their hand-drawn animation in place of a live and costly 3D prototype. Korerorero offers flexible integrations with existing services and enables a contactless user interface - no touchscreen or keyboard is required, so it has the potential to replace touch screen kiosks for check-ins and information searches. Because it’s backed by IBM Watson there are options to integrate with knowledge bases. It could be run as a text-only interface in chat providers such as Whatsapp or as a voice online in a call centre. In plain English terms it could become the digital equivalent of a customer services representative - with a human face that is able to talk and provide answers to people’s queries. It was even being taught to pronounce some words in te reo Māori. …and with non-tech ideas A former colleague came to discuss pitching the Rippl contact tracing app he had privately developed, which led to a decidedly non-tech idea. Amid the race to come up with digital apps it became clear how little focus was going on non-digital contact tracing. This was significant as 20 percent of the population is digitally excluded, overlapping with those more likely to be impacted by the virus. From this, the idea of a hard copy diary was developed and pitched to the COVID Response Team with support from the country’s leading cartoonist who would provide artwork to give added appeal to engage with, and potential to turn the diary into a memento of COVID times. COVID strengthens need to improve Community Services Card The impact of COVID meant many more people will face financial hardship and require a Community Services Card. The card enables automatic discounts on health care costs. For non-beneficiaries, applying for a card is a complex process that - like a Rates Rebate - has low uptake. The Government advises about 90,000 people each year by letter that they are eligible for the card, but only around 20,000 apply. Fortunately, the Ministry of Health had already commissioned a piece of work that had DIA’s Life Events team working with Lab support on improving uptake. As well as identifying large groups of people missing out on this benefit, the team contacted other relevant agencies to scope what would be involved in making this service easier to access, identifying opportunities to increase communication to eligible people. The project was delivered to the Ministry of Health before the Lab closure. The work has laid the foundation for further improvement of this entitlement just as demand ramps up. Focusing on the vulnerable Another team member stepped in to support Manaaki, the Vulnerable Communities Response Unit. A small team was stood up, which applied the Lab’s knowledge of the cross-agency engagement and assisted with coordinating a number of programme related tasks into a triage system to help prioritise the cross-agency/sector/ community response to meet the needs of vulnerable communities across New Zealand."},{"title":"Digital Nations","url":"/projects/digital-nations/","tags":[],"body":""},{"title":"Entering Tertiary Life Event","url":"/projects/entering-tertiary-life-event/","tags":[],"body":"Enrolling in tertiary study is not straight-forward The tertiary education system assumes that learning is a linear path when in fact change and interruption are natural and will occur, especially for the youngest students. Together with TEC, we found several challenges people faced when entering tertiary education These include the quality and relevance of the information, the process they follow, and what stage they are at in their life. The final output of the discovery was a research report and it recommends a number of opportunities for the education sector to explore further. Approach and findings During the prediscovery exercise we focused on the needs of the consumer and the information and services they access. We interviewed and workshopped with 55 students and subject matter experts, and reviewed a wealth of research. We looked at opportunities where things could be done differently. We focused on four areas specific to the needs of someone wanting to enter tertiary education. We looked at what might add value for both students, and their supporters and influencers. We have an opportunity to learn from, and design for, what are typical changes during our lives. “What do I need to know and understand to help me make the best choice for now and for my future?” Students and their supporters (family, peers, teachers etc) need to plan and decide their pathway into tertiary education. Not only for what suits their present life but also their future aspirations. Information relevant to the student’s life, aspirations, personality, and how different study options affect life outcomes, will aid this process. “What and when do I need to share information about myself and what I want to do?” Students need to provide the right information, from the right place at the right time. To increase efficiency and lessen unnecessary effort, we can remove duplicate requests for existing information. Providing timely and actionable information about key choices and events will also help create certainty for students and their supporters so they don’t miss opportunities. “Change is normal, and should be easy”. A typical student’s circumstances change all the time. It means a change in the course of study is highly likely. It happens more often for first-time students and those transitioning from secondary school to tertiary education. Despite this, changing courses often results in significant personal and financial consequences for them. We should recognise that change is normal and natural, and support students through these changes. “Feeling included and supported is key to better outcomes.” Students who feel included and supported typically do better during study and after. There is an opportunity to raise and recognise students’ feelings of connectedness, acceptance, safety, and recognition of their abilities. We could also adapt teaching styles and mediums that help students and their supporters make the best study choices.

Imagine if the creation and implementation of government ‘rules’ (i.e. legislation, regulation, policy) was multidisciplinary, more open, participatory and robust. What if these rules were unambiguous, and understandable and usable by both people and digital government services from the day they are enacted? Better still, what if the wording and logic of the rules was drafted by a multidisciplinary and multi stakeholder team to better capture what the government really intended when creating or amending rules? The practice of making business rules directly available to digital systems as software code has been around for decades, e.g. for tax calculator tools on the IRD website, or internal business systems within government departments. This approach can be thought of as Rules as Code. This is usually done after the rules have already been written and requires a reinterpretation of the rules by service delivery people and software developers. This has proved a risky approach where implementation by government and non-government organisations are out-of-step with either the intent or the actual rules. What is new is testing the implementation logic and service design impacts alongside the policy development process, utilising approaches from other disciplines such as human centred design and test-driven software development. This opening up of the drafting process to include other ways of thinking and testing the rules has been coined ‘Better Rules’. The benefits of this approach Not only does it make the Rules of government accessible to all people and agencies to use and to be easily updated from a single authoritative source, but it represents a fundamental shift in how we draft government rules. It brings multi-disciplinary teams together to look at what’s proposed in a Bill or Amendment: People from policy and operations, software developers and those working on the delivery side: working together to virtually model and test the draft rules, using real data and likely scenarios, to ensure the rules are implementable and more likely to achieve the intended outcome. This represents a real sea change for governments, allowing simultaneously for more complex and more comprehensible rules that can better adapt to edge cases. This is not only about harnessing the speedier benefits of digital. There’s less risk of misinterpretation. It means more issues and errors are identified before the legislation is passed through the rapid iteration of the rulesets during their development. The approach is also more democratic, supporting open, transparent government and enabling NGOs, communities, social enterprises and the private sector to be part of the government services ecosystem. What happened The Better Rules work began early 2018 as a collaboration with Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Parliamentary Counsel Office and a private software company, to explore the digital transformation of legislation and policy (including machine readable Legislation as Code). The Lab provided the environment and led the design process. In parallel, the Lab was also working on it’s first implementations of legislation as code to create digital services to help people to understand their eligibility for government financial help when they started a family (SmartStart), or were a low income homeowner (Rates Rebate). The work generated much interest across Government, local councils, the D7 (now the Digital Nations), the New Zealand Law Foundation, World Bank, World Trade Organisation, European Commission, OECD, and the UN Develop Programme. It led to the development of a Legislation as Code reusable component in the Lab which is currently used for three life event services. A Demonstrator and growing world interest At the end of 2018, the Lab collaborated with counterparts in Israel and Uruguay to build a small Legislation as Code demonstrator to explain the concept using pension eligibility as the example. This was shown to the D7 (now Digital Nations) Ministerial Summit in Israel. Global interest in the Better Rules and Rules as code approaches accelerated after the OECD’s Observatory for Public Sector Innovation selected the Better Rules approach from over 500 public sector innovation case studies to be included in the Embracing Innovation in Government Global Trends Report 2019. The Governments of New South Wales, Canada and the US have since conducted their own Better Rules and Rules as Code experiments. In September 2018 a global Better Rules online discussion forum was launched. Lively discussion is ongoing in this forum as well as on Twitter (#rulesascode, #legislationascode, #betterrules) and LinkedIn (#rulesascode, #legislationascode). By 2019, Better Rules had become its own programme led by MBIE and supported by the Lab. The OECD released a draft rules as code primer in May 2020 as a way to collate everything that is currently understood about Better Rules and rules as code at this time Exploring the Better Rules approach with review of the ACC Act 2001 The Lab facilitated a Discovery workshop over several weeks with the Accident Compensation Corporation and MBIE who wanted to improve the coherence of the eligibility criteria in the ACC Act. This was not an opportunity to re-write this section of the Act, rather to make it more usable by ACC and the public. They were interested in seeing if there is advantage in applying the Better Rules approach. The workshop involved policy, operational and legislative specialists, service design and software developers. ACC concluded the approach was valuable and was written up in the following report: ACC Discovery Report Feedback In November 2019, the OECD’s Observatory for Public Sector Innovation began work on a new Innovation Primer focused on Rules as Code, stating: “Rules as Code presents a new approach to designing rules for human and machine consumption’… it ‘involves rethinking a core function of government and reinventing it for compatibility with our digital age’…. ‘if government is to be truly responsive, transparent and effective, then Rules as Code could be an important part of making this a reality’.” and “The team working to drive New Zealand’s Government into the digital age believes that part of the problem is the way that laws themselves are written. Earlier this year, over a three-week experiment, they tested the theory by rewriting legislation itself as software code. “Their work is turning heads: upon seeing a presentation by the team at Digital Nations Summit in February, Estonia’s Chief Information Officer Siim Sikkut described legislation-as-code as “the most transformative idea’ to come from it. It could be key to creating more and better digital services, and laying the groundwork for the safe use of artificial intelligence in the public sector…” Recent exploration of the Better Rules approach Wellington Council District Plan Discovery (RuBRIC) A Wellington City Council team has developed a pilot project looking at how to incorporate Better Rules methodologies along with rules as code into the review of its District Plan. It is starting with a rules as code implementation of part of the existing District Plan to help people through the resource consent process. Rules as Code in New Zealand The New Zealand Law Foundation late in 2018 funded a 9-month project described as“examining the legal, social, constitutional and democratic implications of converting, drafting and consuming legislation in machine-readable computer languages, commonly known as code.” Improving the All-of-government Payroll Program This project is using Better Rules methodologies to identify and collate practices from government payroll practitioners to understand the potential impacts of new legislation. Ministry for Primary Industries - development of new legislation MPI is exploring the Better Rules approach for new legislation around food safety. The multi-disciplinary team would see the potential rules tested from policy intent through to service design/application considerations and the Rules as Code aspect would help ensure the rules were conceptually and logically sound and implementable.

One of the Lab’s unique approaches /ways of working was to offer free space, when possible, to agencies who just needed somewhere to work. The only cost was they had to have ‘a conversation’ with Lab staff when asked - to share their work with a view to uncovering areas of where either could contribute to the work, knowledge or learning of the other. Brief description of the Ministry Of Education (MOE) project: Tracking the experience of parents as their child moves through the education system from New Entrant (age 5) to the end of their Primary years (approx.. age 12) What happened: A small group of MOE staff, captained by Service Designer Megan Williams, came in to work part-time in a small room for two weeks because they lacked space at their head office. The team grew and it stayed nearly six months in the end. Why? The power of a neutral space for multiple government agency teams to work in meant the MOE team could sit and discuss ideas alongside Life Events, Ministry of Health (MOH), and any number of other teams that were moving through the shared space. The work by each of these teams provided more context and content that could inform the work that Megan’s team was discussing. Thus, the life journey map the MOE team were creating was done alongside existing work, and as a consequence was a much richer and more useful piece of work. The power of….. Neutral space for multiple agencies to work in, away from BAU pressures and ‘mind-ruts’. Serendipity – co-locating agencies who don’t have obvious links. Opening the door to start investing in enduring relationships that may pay dividends quickly or further in the future. (Trusted relationships are fundamental to almost all the Lab’s progress and successes) Benefits Teams across the public sector are using design-thinking methodologies, and tools with human lead approaches – but as long as they remain in their vertical delivery models (MOH, MOE, Ministry of Social Development etc) they will only ever be able to design for a particular subset of the citizen’s experience. To fully deliver better public service, government agencies need spaces that allow them to work collaboratively – not just to meet, but to work together, on understanding how their multiple work streams impact on citizens. In this future state model, individual agencies still own the ability and authority to deliver their respective services, as they are funded; but a neutral, shared space to consider, discuss and design how these services are linked is critical to designing more effective services for all New Zealanders. Another benefit from this approach is that it would enable and lift public sector capacity and capability, and those skills will be developed and further embedded within individual agencies. Testimonial “The Lab’s a great place to talk about your work with others in other agencies. People here are like coaches and they think bigger – and across the whole of the government sector, not just one agency. I’ve really enjoyed the cross-pollination that has resulted from that. We’ve been journey mapping an experience for parents along the education system. Someone in the Lab used to be a principal and came and talked with us. He had a lightbulb moment and talked to us about the work he was involved in with another group looking at early childhood education. You feel this is a place where you can do that ‘bigger thinking’, that ‘future-focused’ thinking - it’s really conducive to that.” Megan Williams, Service Designer, Parents and Community Information group. Ministry of Education"},{"title":"Rates Rebate – moving toward automated delivery of financial entitlements","url":"/projects/rate-rebate/","tags":[],"body":"What is the Rates Rebate Scheme A Rates Rebate is a subsidy of up to $640 a year for low-income homeowners on the cost of their residential rates. The subsidy is delivered by local councils and administered by central Government – Department of Internal Affairs. The rebate is calculated by the cost of the rates, applicant’s income and number of dependants. Every year, people apply by filling out a long, complex paper-based form, providing proof of income and getting their application witnessed by an authorised person. Who was involved From NZ’s 78 local councils: Tauranga City Council and to a lesser extent, councils from Hamilton, Wellington, Kapiti, Auckland and Wellington. Department of Internal Affairs Service Innovation Lab team The aim The Service Innovation Working Group (SIWG) approved an initiative to explore design and delivery of a proactive service with the goal of delivering an automated service. That is, automatically giving people an entitlement or benefit without them having to apply for it. Rates Rebate was identified as a suitable candidate for this approach. Timeline Many people do not apply for a Rates Rebate for a range of reasons, so the starting point was to explore why, by identifying the system barriers. The Discovery phase involved a three-week sprint in Sept 2017 and saw DIA, councils from Tauranga, Auckland and Wellington, the Ministry for Social Development, Inland Revenue, Assurity Consulting and the Lab team mapping an end-to-end service and user journey. The team interviewed stakeholders and explored methods of service delivery. The Alpha phase in mid-2018 used the many system-level opportunities uncovered in the Discovery to improve the experience for both applicants and councils. A minimum viable product (MVP) was developed and trialled by Auckland Council and Tauranga City Council - with progress closely watched by numerous other councils. The MVP was tested with real people, allowing local ratepayers to determine eligibility and apply for a rebate through a digital process. This tested if the alpha could successfully: Provide an online application that could increase the uptake of the Rates Rebate Decrease the cost of processing applications for DIA and councils Improve customer experience and satisfaction levels Improve the ability to digitally deliver this and other services to councils. What was learned Applicant insights: Many people unaware of the entitlement Completing form and obtaining necessary evidence was complex People still had to go to council offices to verify their information Some people reluctant at having to apply for an entitlement Some lacked trust in digital technology and government System and process insights Process is inefficient Costly for councils Peak times hard to staff and manage Council service centre support is critical to success of applications Information and IT systems inconsistent between councils Barriers caused by prescriptive legislation The Beta trial in mid-2019 was run by members from DIA’s Service Delivery and Operations team, Government Information Services, and the Service Innovation Lab.In particular, the beta was designed to: Increase uptake of the Rates Rebate Improve customer experience and satisfaction Decrease the cost of processing applications for councils Improve the ability to digitally deliver this and other services to councils Support the case to remove the statutory declaration (witnessed signature requirement) Produce insights informing other use cases with a similar customer profile The Service Innovation Lab invited three councils (Tauranga City Council, Hutt City Council, and Kāpiti Coast District Council) to participate from a larger group that expressed interest. The three councils each ran a different IT system for processing applications, providing a good test of any proposed process changes, and a good indication of the challenges of rolling out the solution more widely. What was learned and what changes resulted The application form requested far more information than was legally required. It was edited down significantly. Speed: the paper application took about 25 mins to complete; the digital process about 4 minutes. Savings: There was significant council savings on cost and staff time. Ease: Councils observed people were finding digital an easier process. Applicants didn’t know if entitled to a rebate until form was completed – a calculator was introduced to ascertain this at the start of the process. During the beta, content changes based on Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) research made the content more findable in Google and simplified the user journey. The statutory declaration remains the single biggest barrier preventing large scale adoption of an online application process (as well as a significant barrier to those applying on paper). *Removing the statutory declaration removes the requirement to visit a council to submit an application. This is the last barrier to becoming fully digital. The team sought a legislative change to have this removed and this looks likely to happen in 2020. Lessons for others Research generated will be useful for other projects working with older people. The work provides an example for other government initiatives considering going online with their application forms. It proved that eliminating the need for paper forms and paper-based evidence significantly reduces material and human resource costs. What could have been done better In hindsight, one thing that could have been managed differently was to invest at the start in building relationships to ensure firmer buy-in from an eventual owner of the ‘product’ to secure continuance to BAU. Where to from here Recommendation and decision by DIA as to whether to commit to a roadmap for delivery that could include engaging with more councils, more user testing and research, more development or full development. DIA as custodian of the Rates Rebates process will ultimately make a decision based on the work done and their own priorities whether to continue development to full production. Awards The Lab’s work on Rates Rebate was recognised at the 2018 Open Source Awards. Testimonials Tauranga City Council’s Manager of Revenue, Jimmy Taylor: “I was buzzing after yesterday’s conference call. You, and Karyn and the DIA inno(vation) team, have achieved big wins in this phase already. Awesome…Not needing proof or collecting unnecessary information is huge for us, and presumably the back office in the rebate team. ….I love that you are implementing transformational change rather than plastering over the cracks.” Feedback from people involved in the Alpha: Pilot applicant “I would do it online next time” User testing “I didn’t know government things could be like this”* First applicant on Tauranga pilot “I’m partially blind, so if things are on a computer I can zoom in and read them”*"},{"title":"Renting a property","url":"/projects/renting-a-property/","tags":[],"body":"How deeper exploration of an issue, employing cross-agency teams – along with alternative lenses – resulted in a total turnaround in understanding the key influencer in the property rental experience. What happened The Renting a Property Discovery was the first life event work where the Lab applied wellbeing frameworks to inform development of potential government services. The Service Innovation Working Group SIWG authorised a small cross-agency team to explore ‘Renting a Property’ as a life event from a holistic, all-of-government perspective. This life event was chosen because renting had increased from 23% in 1991 to 33% in 2016. Many rentals don’t support their occupants well when compared with owner-occupied houses: 31% of rental houses feel damp, compared to 11% of owner- occupied houses 22% of rental homes have no fixed heating sources 56% of rental homes had visible mould, compared to 44% of owner-occupied houses In mid-2018, the team ran a short two-part Discovery that explored landlord-tenant relationships. Their starting point was the hypothesis that a better rental house will result in a better relationship between tenant and landlord. The aim was to find out more about the relationships and the house itself. This was essentially a fact-finding mission as a foundation for future work. Significant research had already been undertaken. The team built on this by reviewing over 48 documents that provided insights into renting from landlord, property manager and tenant perspectives, and conducted in-depth interviews with 60 stakeholders. Who was involved Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Housing New Zealand (HNZ) Work and Income NZ (WINZ) Service Innovation Lab What was learned The team validated its original design statement by the end of week three, but with a twist: they discovered it was actually better relationships that influence the quality of the homes. Tenants who had good relationships were less likely to go into dispute with their landlords, more likely to raise issues, and see improvements, and this in turn would improve the quality of the property. The power of… Deep investigation to really explore the problem before moving too fast to look for a solution The value of cross-agency teams bringing different perspectives (also powerful element in the Better Rules work) Listening directly to the customer voice Using a different lens to bring fresh a view of a problem What was delivered The findings were used by MBIE’s Tenancy Services to inform:: Design and development of a possible Tenancy Agreement Builder – direct outcome/concept from the Discovery, supported by the evidence gathered. Tenancy Bond Strategy – informing further research into the strategic role and direction of the Tenancy Bond. Healthy Homes Standards campaign strategy – feeding into research for the strategic direction of public engagement with the Healthy Homes Standards Multiple stakeholder engagement strategies with various audiences (e.g. Property Managers; Māori; etc.) Looking into the viability of setting up online training modules that support Tenants, Landlords and Property Managers A primer for new staff, and to raise awareness of the importance of relationships, behaviour change, tenant fear and other problems in the market. Where to from here The scope of this research was seen as quite narrow; it kept throwing up issues such as housing affordability and lack of housing stock. The research remains available as a foundation for more comprehensive exploration of this topic in future. The value of incorporating a Māori cultural lens The incorporation of a Māori wellbeing lens led to an aligned piece of research into Kainga as home has a far richer significance for Māori. The concept can be linked to being prepared for when your living circumstances change, given Māori are less likely to own their own home. Kāinga has transformed as many families / whānau have moved from rural to urban settings, so kāinga for many now would be a 2-3 bedroom home on an urban section. It is also connected to the holistic concept of whānau – family providing shelter, warmth and an opportunity to nurture potential. Many of the project team were from the agencies involved in administering state housing. It was the kainga work that placed the importance on a home rather than a house, alongside the relationships required for a positive rental experience. During interviews, using the Māori cultural lens was what led to the discovery that positive relationships between the landlord and tenant had a direct connection to healthier homes, even if the home was unhealthy to start with. DIA senior advisor Tiopira Piripi who developed the Kāinga work stream. “As they started this work they soon discovered 40 per cent of their customers were Māori so understanding kāinga was therefore essential to the work. It really opened their eyes and had quite a profound effect on some.”"},{"title":"Sharing work across the public sector","url":"/projects/sharing/","tags":[],"body":"What Happened The Lab team became involved in ‘educational’ activities, as the idea of a Government innovation Lab with a focus on building cross-agency collaboration was quite new and unique. A clever visual storyteller, Kim Quirke, designed collateral that was used to tell stories about the Lab’s approach. The All-of-Government Showcase The day-long, twice-yearly Showcase is co-hosted by the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment and the Department of Internal Affairs. Venues have ranged from the Beehive, MBIE and Te Papa, the national museum.

The police team was developing AI “(digital twin Bella)” to manage high volume, low level interactions with the public, such as reporting lost property so staff could be freed to address more serious crime. As with others who came in just to use the facility, there was passive idea-sharing – which in this case coincided with the Lab’s Emerging Tech team having just started a project with DIA’s Digital Rights and Ethics team to understand how governments might use such technologies as virtual reality (VR). In this case to enable policy-makers to get a greater sense of empathy for the people and situation their policies are addressing. What happened The rise in online communication has seen a shift in socially acceptable behaviour as a result of the anonymity and the ‘safety’ of a screen between people. Politeness is often being replaced with confrontation and at the extreme end there is “snowflakes”, “flamewars”, “doxing” and industrialised outrage. The project focussed on the cause-and-effect chains of online hate speech. It developed a VR tool called the Online Social Norms VR , an experience that gives a sense of how the public service may begin to use near-future technologies as a research strategy to inform policy development for complex social issues. In this case two scenarios were created – enabling a person to sit behind a set of screens and ‘become’ someone sending online hate messages. They could then step into a second scenario and become the recipient of the hateful messages they’d just sent: being first the perpetrator, then the victim. The VR tool has been used to give a sense of how the public service may begin to use near-future technologies in exploring aspects of a strategic policy issue. In this case allowing analysts to see and understand the drivers and impacts of online hate speech. We also show how near-future tech such as VR can support future policy development to be better informed by evidence led, contextual experience. Alongside the tool, the team created an ethics plan as a guide to making sure ethical risks in such a project are considered and justifiable, and that measures are put in place to manage these. International interest This project was driven by the Digital Rights and Ethics team as part of the Government Chief Digital Officers office within the Department of Internal Affairs. It was presented and shared internationally as part of New Zealand’s contributions to the Digital Nations group (a collaborative network of the world’s leading digital governments). The project was shared internationally as part of New Zealand’s contribution to the Digital Nations group, a collaborative network of the world’s “leading digital governments”.

Many of the team were able to recite their pepeha - introduce themselves in Māori and briefly describe the places of significance to them. They learned basic Māori, sang waiata and recited karakia before key meetings. This left an impression on people from other agencies. On some it had quite a profound effect, creating a willingness to learn more, especially when public servants suddenly became aware of just how many of their ‘customers’ were Māori and how little tikanga featured in service design. Mihi whakatau Every visitor experienced a whakatau or mihimihi, cultural practices Māori use to ensure manuhiri are treated with respect and go home with an experience to remember. For more formal welcomes, a mihi whakatau,was essential to the practice of whanaungatanga because connection between people was a central tenet of the Lab. The Lab had many domestic and international visitors. Manuhiri were sent information before their visit. Staff met them at the door and provided further information to ensure they were comfortable with the practice. Once inside, a hongi was performed. This saw the visitors gently pressing noses to symbolise the sharing of Haa/breath - acknowledging the first breath of mankind according to Māori history. After this came a whaikorero / speeches between the hosts and manuhiri followed by a waiata. Manuhiri responded with their own speech generally in a language they were comfortable with. A large Vietnamese delegation delighted everyone when they responded with their own welcoming song in Chinese about Ho Chi Minh City - most visitors being too shy to attempt this challenge. Their singing was joyful, bringing both groups closer despite one of the most significant language barriers the team had been faced with from a visiting group. Visitors to the Service Innovatin Lab Once the formal welcome and sharing of kai / food was completed the tour proceeded. International visitors are increasingly interested in exchanging ideas and seeing how innovative governments are becoming in delivering their services; they particularly loved the unique cultural experience that came as an integral part of their visit to the Lab. Many delegations later tell their host agencies their Lab experience was a highlight of their New Zealand visit. None of this would have been possible without the expertise of a Māori employee Tiopira Piripi who was well rehearsed in tikanga Māori and was a valuable adviser. Visitors have included OECD Deputy Secretary General Ulrik Vestergaard Knudsen, D9 Secretariat Jordan Storozuk, New South Wales Government Chief Information and Digital Officer Greg Wells, and delegations from the Pacific, Vietnam, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

This issue was brought to the Department of Internal Affairs’ Life Events Team which enlisted the Lab to facilitate a day-log hui. Diverse stakeholders were invited: agencies, NGOs and families who had experienced loss. This proved so fruitful a second hui followed. The Life Events Team then led collaboration with the Ministry of Justice, Inland Revenue and Sands (a non-profit baby loss support organisation) and Catalyst IT to develop an online support resource: Whetūrangitia. What was the aim To explore a solution to lack of support for parents, families and whānau who had suffered the death of a child during pregnancy, at birth, or during infancy. The aim was to see if there was a piece of work that could be explored in either a research or design discovery. These initial conversations are critical in helping peel back the layers and get to understand if there is a potential issue. The Service Innovation Lab’s scoping process is a critical part of clarifying this. The initial content focussed on navigating the complexities of the coronial process and clarifying financial entitlements, along with support resources for parents. More information, support and resources will be added to the website over time. Who was involved DIA Life Events team Service Innovation Lab Ministry of Justice Inland Revenue Sands (a non-profit baby loss support organisation) Catalyst IT Cultural design principle: whānau pani One of the design principles was based on the Māori concept of whānau pani. Part of tangihanga, this concept describes the process by which those in grief, in this case the bereaved parents, are allowed to be in grief, while those they trust, their whānau pani, do what is required to help them to navigate this time. The site and service is intended to provide whānau pani, enabling parents to be in grief, and to empower them at their time of greatest pain. Supporting Government goal to create unified public service A good example of where integrated services can provide a better experience of government, supporting the real needs of people in everyday life. As the groundswell around digital government grows, these types of services will become more common, accessible and be improved continuously. Whetūrangitia is one of a growing number of life event products that has attracted considerable interest from overseas and praise from Government at home. What was learned The hui with bereaved parents was undoubtedly the most rewarding part for participants. It built empathy and trusted relationships were developed. It was important to create a safe space for parents to share their stories and experiences about baby loss freely. Their stories shaped the direction of the design and parents remained involved in a feedback loop throughout. You can’t create legislation and policy for a situation such as this without understanding people - identifying this issue properly shows what a great deal of care and integrity the public sector can have. The power of… The Lab’s strong emphasis on: collaboration across diverse stakeholders involving all stakeholders in the conversation from the start, including the ‘customer’ allowing generous time – to build trust and to ‘turn over as many stones around the issue as possible’ in order to uncover new facets, and to confirm whether this really is the problem or just a symptom of different problem relationship-building; empathy"},{"title":"Getting government listening to youth voices Project ‘Bagel’","url":"/projects/youth-voice/","tags":[],"body":"Project Bagel was a project a Department of Internal Affairs team undertook in collaboration with the Ministry of Youth Development (MYD) late in 2019. Its aim was to help government listen to what young people wanted. Anonymising project names – such as ‘bagel’, ‘feijoa’, ‘croissant’ – ensures those working on them are more likely to come without pre-conceived ideas of a solution. The MYD team had already co-designed, with young people, a tool to seek input and feedback on government policy:The Hive. The aim of Project Bagel was to ensure those voices would be genuinely considered in the development of government policy. The initial expectations for Bagel were that we would use sentiment analysis to capture the voice of youth, which could then be used by policy makers. Sentiment analysis is the use of machine learning tools to estimate how positive or negative the feeling in a piece of text is. We tested our initial assumptions behind this with user-centred methods, including talking to policy practitioners across government and rapid prototyping. We learned that many of these initial assumptions were wrong, or could benefit from some redirection. Through the process of research, discovery, design and prototyping, we identified opportunities to improve how policy practitioners analyse feedback on government policy and legislation. The stakes in this area are huge — the health of our democracy, honouring Te Tiriti, and the quality of policy and legislation across the board. The formal outputs of the project were: an introduction to machine learning for policy practitioners a list of digital tools for analysing policy feedback and submissions a guide to communicating back to constituents who have made submissions. Insights 1. Sentiment analysis is great for finding a heartbeat in a deluge of data, but not reliably accurate enough for lasting analysis We tested feedback from New Zealanders on the Zero Carbon Bill on sentiment analysis tools like VaDER as well as cloud tools from Amazon, Google and Microsoft. The results (available on GitHub) were just not accurate enough to inform policy. 2. If an agency wants to know how people feel about an issue, they can ask that directly Agencies often run surveys to get feedback on policy questions, when they could just request free-text submissions. That said, if they want to know how favourably people feel about something specific, they’ll get a much more accurate response if they ask directly, rather than run sentiment analysis over free text. 3. The sentiment of a submission doesn’t always reflect its content Someone may be broadly supportive, but spend far more of the text pointing out problems with a policy. The general sentiment of a submission does not indicate what a person does or does not support. 4. Generically-trained natural language processing tools don’t have the subject area knowledge to detect specific areas of policy or legislative feedback Machine learning tools are a product of the data they have been trained with, and without specific training on the subject area their usefulness is limited. 5. There are many issues with aggregating social media posts to inform policy making There are ethical concerns around privacy and consent from scraping social media posts without peoples’ knowledge or consent. It may also not be possible to sort the concerns of New Zealand constituents out from the wider global conversation or the activity of coordinated bot attacks - and when presenting only aggregated and processed data, it runs the risk of laundering unrepresentative views. 6. Policymakers aren’t familiar with the abilities and limitations of machine learning tools Policymakers may believe these tools are more powerful than they really are, giving the output more weight than is appropriate – or they may be sceptical that they have any value. Avenues for further work There is potential for topic modelling and clustering before manual analysis of submissions Natural language processing technology can be used on a first pass of submissions, finding patterns that would take humans much longer to identify. Theme extraction (also known as topic modelling) can help to identify unexpected patterns before the categories for further analysis are set. Clustering documents into groups that share themes could assist with assigning documents for further analysis. There is potential for better analysis to lead into better two-way communication with people who engage with government Communication back to people who submit to consultations is often limited. If we have a better understanding of what people have said and how it fits in with what everyone else has said, we can relay that back to them, get feedback on whether we’ve heard them accurately, and let them know how their views fit into the wider community. There is a need for more flexible and easier-to-use tagging and theming tools that allow for cross-agency use and for data to be exported and analysed further Many of the tools used for tagging and theming submissions make it difficult to collaborate or analyse data further, limiting their usefulness. There is a need for better cross-agency (and intra-agency) sharing of data analysis skills and tools Data analysis is a powerful part of the policymaker’s toolkit – but those skills aren’t universal, and the tools aren’t always easy to access or use. Those who are well-equipped for this may be in data science rather than policy roles, and collaboration is infrequent. What else is happening in the AI /machine learning space that links to this project? The Strategy for a Digital Public Service identifies the need to establish strong digital foundations that can be used across the public sector. This includes, for example, determining appropriate policy and regulatory requirements for emerging technologies, such as AI. This will ensure new technologies are adopted lawfully, safely, transparently, and with the continued support of the public. There is no legal framework that is explicitly for AI, but a range of legal protections around accuracy, privacy, security, freedom and discrimination already apply in New Zealand. Before using AI/machine learning for policy applications, you should consider the Principles for safe and effective use of data and analytics that were developed by the Privacy Commissioner and Stats NZ. There is emerging work on potential ways to introduce greater regulation of how government uses of AI technologies. This includes, for example, the development of the Algorithm Charter by Stats NZ, and New Zealand is partnering with the World Economic Forum on the Reimagining regulation in the age of AI project on how governments, business and society can work together to meet the challenge of regulating AI."},{"title":"10% work","url":"/approach/10-percent-work/","tags":[],"body":"Rubber-bands, post-it notes and a bit of glue - the ‘10 percent’ work Because the ways of working within the Lab were innovative, iterative and rather unfamiliar to outsiders - some believed Lab staff were “doing their own random stuff”. There was criticism. In fact, 10 percent of team members’ time was unallocated, which they could devote to uncommissioned work. This often saw them looking at what new digital concepts could be used to support existing government services, then experimenting to see if there was a fit. The important thing was that these small tests and prototypes meant the Lab reduced the risk and sped up the process of learning, as only a small amount of time and money was being invested to see if an idea would work. This was the innovator’s version of a Business Case; where the ‘business case’ is actually shown, rather than described. “It’s a quick build to better explain the concept. It’s a rubber-bands, post-it notes and a bit of glue kind of thing. You stand it up fast, then iterate..iterate…iterate - this really is about building it as you fly it. You don’t go for a perfect finished product but instead stand something up fast and then refine, improve, iterate and keep on learning,” says Stakeholder Relationship Manager Grant Carpenter. “It was a way to pitch to people so they can quickly say ‘Yes, we want to commission the work’ or ‘No – not interested’ or ‘Not interested just now…’ This led to several pilots, prototypes and further repurposing of reusable components. An MVP was built to demonstrate the value of the consent-based data sharing concept (‘Feijoa’) and shown to the Service Innovation Reference Group to trigger a conversation about what was possible. Feijoa started with a discussion on what it would take to hold shareable information, grew into an MVP and was picked up and is now being progressed as part of the SmartStart integrated service - the Early Years project. Other initiatives that were the focus of ‘10 percent’ time included: Better Rules - This was a little serendipitous as the lead for a French team working on the same concept for their government was in NZ at the time we began the work. Matti (French visitor) was able to help kick off some of the original code thinking and support the coding of specific rule sets for a calculator. Brenda Wallace and Rachel Prosser worked on this and the work was later picked up by Nadia Webster. The Family Services Directory kicked off in a similar way when the team was looking at location data and services, this grew into an additional MSD service. Korerorero and the COVID calculator Croissant, to a degree, started from discussions around AI and natural language processing and its uses. There was also some work undertaken on voice interaction with services as opposed to text. There were some ideas that did not fly.These included looking at bitcoin concepts to hold personal identity data, trying to expand Openfisca to other work, and some of the exploration of virtual reality. However, we were testing ideas and therefore avoiding the trap of vendors trying to sell dreams that could not be made to work."},{"title":"How we worked","url":"/approach/elements/","tags":[],"body":"Lab elements A helpful way to understand the Service Innovation Lab is to think about the elements that made up its purpose, how it works and what it focused on. These elements help to frame how the lab is both similar and different to other labs and innovation teams. Located inside government - Located close to decision-makers, policy and operational teams. Supporting cross-agency working backed by shared funding and governance arrangements. Cross agency collaboration - Bring teams together to find better ways to deliver the joined-up services. Creating new resources, knowledge and networks. Digital focus - Advances in digital technology and access to it are a crucial enabler for integrating services in particular digital identity. It can help people to undertake online what they have traditionally completed manually. Life events - Bring together the information and services of different agencies which relate to the same life event into one place to make access easier for people. Integrated services - Joining up and automating services around key events in people’s lives (life events) to make it easier for citizens to access government services. Experimentation seeds innovation - Make innovation through experimentation a core part of service design and delivery. Cross agency governance - Senior engagement from across agencies. Buying from senior leaders supports a culture of collaboration. Lab as a space - Offering a neutral physical space for teams to host projects and access coaching and advice. Lab as a team - Interdisciplinary with experience of working with complexity, agile development, design, stakeholder engagement and working across government. Human-centred design - Putting people at the centre of developing more integrated services. Better understanding their experiences and what can make public services more accessible. Agile development - Using tools and techniques that support open, iterative and collaborative working with a focus on delivering value and working quickly. Open-source - Committed making work open, accountable and responsive to other government teams and citizens. Shares tools, data, insight and code."},{"title":"Joined Up","url":"/approach/joined-up/","tags":[],"body":"The opportunity Questions about how we work beyond our vertical public service accountabilities to rapidly deliver joined up, citizen-centric services was central to shaping the Service Innovation Lab’s approach. It prompts questions about: How do we prioritise, commission and lead cross-agency service delivery? How do we ensure everyone is on board? How do we quickly deliver better services into the hands of citizens? Three pillars guided the teams focus in response. Weighting of the three elements will vary, but every successful cross agency delivery initiative will require buy-in and contribution across all levels. 1. Authorising environment This spans people and groups who can provide the authority, resources and mandate for the work to happen. Involvement is typically at a governance level. People here are often several steps away from the work. Bridging that gap is a key consideration. People in the authorising environment have a crucial role creating the conditions for cross-agency working, keeping the focus on delivery and demonstrating leadership by ensuring effective new ideas are implemented and sustained. 2. Creating a culture of collaboration That is exists is essential for joined up working. Needs to be present at all levels of work for effective cross-agency working. Time and effort here is just as important as the work itself. In some instances this might be ‘the work’ especially where the technical capability to delivery is in place. It is strongly relational and trust based. It may need new skills, structures, processes and routines created to grow and sustain collaborative mindsets and practice. 3. Focusing on delivery Creating value and contributing to better outcomes for people who access and use services is one key way a team or lab can demonstrate its effectiveness. It requires both a short and long term perspective. Design led and Agile development practice are combined to focus on working quickly to prototype and test minimum viable products (MVPs). Working openly and ‘showing not telling’ helps people to see and be part of the work. Making work visible to sponsors and decision makers especially where it is underpinned by strong collaborative practice generates support within the authorising environment. Quick health check questions to ask about your project Authorising environment What is the level of maturity of the authorising environment for commissioning cross-agency working? If not, what would it take to build or shape it? What are the characteristics of an effective authorising environment for your work? What are the risks of proceeding with work where a mandate doesn’t exist? Are decision-makers committed to providing resources for current work and implementation How will you keep commissioners engaged in the work and supportive of a focus on collaboration and delivery? Culture of collaboration Is everyone who needs to be involved on board with the work? How will you know if a culture of collaboration is not present? What symptoms will you look for? How will you create shared purpose, intent, culture and a space to work across the team? How are you create a collaborative approach that brings together people working in policy, operation and implementation Delivery How can you demonstrate delivery and value in a way that provides a reason for further collaboration and support from your authorising environment? How will you know if work on development and delivery is not on track? What symptoms will you look for to help guide how you respond? How will you balance demonstrating value and progress while also creating space for deep work? When does delivery stop for your team? Who will take over, how will they be involved early and how will implementation be resourced? How can you create opportunities for people in the authorising environment to experience the work and engage with users/citizens?"},{"title":"How we worked - operating model","url":"/approach/operating-model/","tags":[],"body":"How the lab team worked The lab was an interdisciplinary team with backgrounds in agile, design, policy and technology. It used evidence-based decision making and design thinking to transform government service experiences. We worked in the open to prevent problem shifting and duplication and increase the sharing, reuse and adaptation of tools and approaches. Our approach aimed to reduce risk and increase the impact of innovation across government. By partnering with other agencies, not for profits, private organisations and other governments we sought to understand, identify and test the best ways to create lasting change. While we had a digital focus we ensured people’s needs are considered first by collaboratively working on creating customer-centric services. There were two ways teams worked with the lab: Wrap-around support - partnering with the lab team to help deliver live projects Accessing the lab space - Using the workshop spaces and access to a collaborative environment and the lab’s networks In addition people and teams connected with the lab through its governance structures and wider national and international networks. Wrap around support This would primarily happen for activity or projects aligned to the lab’s work programme. It would involve teams embedding/seconding staff to the lab. The lab team would provide dedicated innovation support and access to a cross-government pool of knowledge and expertise including development, design, engagement and facilitation support. Project examples “Rates rebate project” “Entering Tertiary Education Life Event” “Rates rebate project” Access to Lab space Another way the Lab supported agencies was sharing their space and letting teams host workshop, meetings and even project teams. The Lab team hosted rather than offering wrap-around support and it support shared learning, brought new expertise into the Lab space and enabled guest teams to tap into wider networks across government. It was a popular option reflected in the demand for access for the space but highlighted the absence of similar spaces across government agencies. Project examples “Mapping the parent journey - Ministry of Education” Sponsors and governance The Lab had both a cross-agency governance and reference group. The cross-agency governance group consisted of senior decision-makers from a range of agencies. The Lab was part of a wider remit focused on service innovation and the group made decisions about resource allocation and work programming. A cross-agency reference group enabled the Lab team to access a cross-section of managers and advisors to help oversee and facilitate the delivery of the work programme. For both these groups the lab team, its space and work programme offered a live experiment that was generating learning about working in different ways and across agencies even if their agencies wasn’t directly involved. Visitors and wider networks As a cross-agency innovation lab, there was significant interest in the Lab’s purpose, model and work. The team hosted numerous visitors and delegations from across New Zealand. Working with NZTE the team regularly hosts overseas delegations. As part of a wider New Zealand and international network of innovation teams and the Lab was a case study work for led by the OECD on public sector innovation. “Sharing work across the public sector” “OECD, Observatory of Public Sector Innovation case study”"},{"title":"Our principles and mindsets","url":"/approach/principles-mindsets/","tags":[],"body":"Principles to guide the work Eight principles have guided the Lab’s cross agency work since 2017. They are reflected throughout the Lab’s work and across the project stories. Uniting to meet user needs Doing the hard things to make it easy Learning and improving rapidly Proving value or stopping Doing the least for the greatest impact Building for reuse and openness Accepting help and challenge Openly and widely talking about our work Mindsets for joined up working [INSERT VISUAL FROM REPORT?] One of the lab’s key roles was to ‘enable a culture of experimentation and adaptiveness’. Often this meant encouraging and modelling different ways to think about and approach the work. Below are some of the mindsets that can both help and get in the way of working differently. Mindsets that support the work Trusting and empowering - Creating space for people to work together requires trust. It means working with integrity - walking our talk. Humility and patience - A collaborative approach means valuing all contributions and starting where people are at. Empathy, put people at the centre - Seeking to understand what the system looks like from their perspective wherever they sit. Curiosity, courage and creativity - Being open to exploring new ideas and possibilities, and finding ways to explore them with others. Thinking like a system - Staying focused on the issues but taking time to identify connections, relationships with other areas. Open and adaptive - A growth mindset supports exploring and trying new things - building on learning and experience. Mindsets that can hold us back the work Expedience and quick wins - Seeking simple solutions to complex challenges can reinforce short-term thinking. Fixed mindset - Holding a narrow view of ourselves and others reduced our openness to collaborative approaches, new knowledge and think creatively. What’s in it for me? - Territorial / siloed thinking makes collaborative working harder, with win/win opportunities missed. Fear of failure - Can sit at a personal, team and organisational level and foster a tacit and explicit resistance to new ideas. Solutionism and perfectionism - For complex challenges that involve a range of agencies there may not be a single ‘solution’ and the work will be ongoing. Insider / outsider mindsets - Losing the balance between working with the system that hosts it and offering positive challenge and disruption."},{"title":"3. Discovery phase","url":"/process/process-discovery/","tags":[],"body":"Discovery phase In brief Research discovery - focuses on in-depth research into the subject matter. It is particularly important to help better understand complex issues such as a ‘Life Event’. Design discovery - typically follows research discovery and focuses on creating and developing prototypes and concepts. These may be new products / services / approaches or adapted versions of ideas identified through the ‘Research Discovery’ phase. Research discovery A research discovery is a substantial piece of research investigation and evidencing. It is applicable to complex issues that fall within but are not limited to, a ‘Life Event’. Action: in-depth research into the subject matter. Capability uplift of an external team (where applicable), co-design, collaboration and outreach. Embed evidential design rigor, apply quantitative and qualitative research and evidencing. Deliverable: A research discovery document with findings and next steps actions. Reports of all the evidence and findings. Suggestion on areas to develop further through a Design Discovery. Outcome: At the end of this discovery. Time will be taken to drawn up a ‘Project Roadmap’. The roadmap builds on the project scope document and details all the operational requirements to meet the outcomes defined and agreed in from the research discovery. Design discovery A Design Discovery focuses developing and testing possible solutions. It addresses the feasibility, capability and usability of a testable product or service. It can be a standalone product / service or a product / service that has emerged from work undertaken in the Research Discovery phase. A Design Discovery has four distinct stages: 1 - Design scope 2 - Problem Definition 3 - Problem Validation 4 - Solution Validation For a product / service to be designed and built within the Lab it must pass through the four design stages. A stage-gate acts a failsafe at the end of each stage where a design is assessed before further progress is committed to. User experience design and research testing is extensively required at each point. Action: Design scope - Suggested concepts are scoped for design feasibility Problem Definition - An evidenced problem is defined that can be designed for Problem Validation - Is the design problem meeting the wider project needs? Solution Validation - what are the design solutions, use testing to validate them Deliverables: Design scope - A design brief for the design team to work from Problem Definition - Design Problem or Problem Statements Problem Validation - Evidencing of the design approach to meet the problem space (UX research) Solution Validation - Lo-fi testing and validation of the solutions proposed (UX) Outcome: On conclusion of a Design Discovery a clear design approach has been formulated and a prototype can be green lite to proceed.

A development team is formed including a representative from the design group, a SCRUM master, and programmers. Product definition is the beginning of the technology development process and works in tandem with the designers solution validation stage. In this phase technology prototypes are built based on meeting the criteria of minimum viable product (MVP). This is a build phase with tangible testable working prototype that can be tested with the target audience. A product is validated against several criteria: Functionality Useability Scalability Design criteria: does the product fulfil the need? and impact the problem? outlined in the both the research and design discovery phases? Features Creating technology prototypes are tangible, testable working prototypes suitable to be put in front of the target audience Seeking opportunities to create reusable components Ongoing engagement with sponsors and governance groups is essential to maintain support especially the work moves towards testing and implementation Activities / outputs Verification that the alpha matches MVP design Confirmation design meets the needs identified earlier in the project Evaluation report Beta testing Purpose On conclusion of product validation handover begins. Both the project and products are handed back to the relevant agency and /or partners. A receiving devOps team is key so the product can be scaled and deployed outside of the lab environment. A new product/service will most likely be built ground-up, based on the Alpha. Alternatively the Alpha may be enhanced and hardened by adding features and other changes to ensure it is fit for production. This will be done in partnership with the agencies and their technology partners. A service has been built which meets the demands of a live environment. This includes an understanding of how to build and scale the service while continuously making improvements to meet user needs. There must also be a commitment to fund the team required to do this on an ongoing basis. Activities/outputs For agency(s) and lab team to have a clear understanding of what the partnering and handover options are for the agency to take over the Alpha and develop further. Activities include: Manage expectations of the work required to develop the service/product further Reporting, storytelling and pitching benefits of the beta Key lab team reflections for this phase Feedback loops and iteration Warm people up and engage them in the story of the work Focus on continuous testing, iteration and adaption Include users, sponsors and stakeholders throughout Set clear expectations about what your seeking feedback on Adapt the project team to fit the work The process might be more technical and tighter. New skills and experience may be required in the project team such as developers Developers involved at this stage will ideally have had earlier involvement in the work and have a clear understanding of the project If this is possible someone in the team needs to be responsible for briefing new team members Establishing clear roles and responsibilities when people leave and join the team is key to supporting project continuity Handover and implementation Provide clear communications and an action plan for your project sponsors Create time to support the team who will take ownership of the work Ensure they are clear about what implementation and ownership will require and for how long"}]}
