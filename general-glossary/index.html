        <td>Agile was originally an approach for software development (but is now being adopted more widely in different industries). The agile method gives teams the ability to take requirements and allows for their solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organising and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. It focuses the team on 'just enough' (or minimal viable product) and those pieces of work should be able to be completed within a one to two week planning cycle.

With the focus not being purely on software development the original Manifesto for Agile Software Development has evolved to Modern Agile (see links following), which makes agile as a method accessible to other industries.The values and principles have been derived from and underpin a broad range of frameworks, including Scrum and Kanban.</td>

1) Test the hypotheses created in the Design Discovery phase.
2) Test that the service you want to build is technically possible

Research is completed with a small group of users, and early feedback is gathered about the design of the service.

Computer programs are typically organised and assembled into some type of software components that are combined to form larger IT systems.  To prevent a massive tangle of complex software in which every piece of software is able to talk to every other piece of software, interfaces (or APIs) are used to partition the IT system.  

An API hides a lot of detail of the internal workings of a software component that the outside world does not need to know.  In this way, APIs provide a description of how to use the functionality of a software component and to exchange data with it.  At run-time, software components interact with one another through the application programming interface.

Governments are currently thinking about APIs for service delivery, including how open government APIs can be used to deliver innovative services by third parties, and by businesses to directly transact with government.</td>
        <td>"There are over a thousand applications which use the Trade Me API, built by individuals or organisations outside Trade Me. These applications provide services which meet needs of users not catered for by the Trade Me website or API - in some cases by providing a different interface to the same underlying functions - and in other cases by mashing up a combination of APIs."

NZ Companies Office: "We offer a range of APIs that help our customers to build software that connects directly to our systems."

An intelligent agent is any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.

In everyday usage, "artificial intelligence" refers to any time when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".</td>
        <td>Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as Chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, and intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations.

Machine learning algorithms (software) are a subset of AI algorithms - these are computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience (they are trained to recognise patterns). 

For any system that learns, the output is determined by the input it receives. There are therefore many sources of bias. These sources include (but are not limited to!) the data we use to train systems, and our interactions with them in the “wild". </td>

Archetypes are steeped in user behavior. They contain details from user interviews around a group’s needs, motivations and pain-points.

        <td>There are two common categories of encryption:

1) Aymmetric-key ciphers, also referred to as "secret key," use a single key, sometimes referred to as a shared secret because the system doing the encryption must share it with any entity it intends to be able to decrypt the encrypted data. The most widely used symmetric-key cipher is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which was designed to protect government classified information. The challenge with this form of encryption is that the sender must exchange the key used to encrypt the data with the recipient before the recipient can perform decryption on the ciphertext. The need to securely distribute and manage large numbers of keys means most cryptographic processes use a symmetric algorithm to efficiently encrypt data, but they use an asymmetric algorithm to securely exchange the secret key.

2) Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses two different but mathematically linked keys, one public and one private. The public key can be shared with everyone (and is used to encrypt data), whereas the private key must be kept secret (as it is used to decrypt data which has been encrypted with the private key). The RSA encryption algorithm is the most widely used public key algorithm (the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) used by web browsers using the HTTPS protocol). 
This form of cryptography can also be used to ensure the integrity (was the data altered since being encrypted), authenticity (are you sure it came from the source you think it did) of data through the use of digital signatures.</td>

"You may be wondering why you would want to test a hypothesis just to find it false. Why not just test an alternate hypothesis and find it true? The short answer is that it is part of the scientific method. In science, propositions are not explicitly "proven." Rather, science uses math to determine the probability that a statement is true or false. It turns out it's much easier to disprove a hypothesis than to positively prove one. Also, while the null hypothesis may be simply stated, there's a good chance the alternate hypothesis is incorrect."</td>

        <td>User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told (usually) from the perspective of the person who desires the new feature/item - generally at user or customer of the the work you are delivering. They are generally written in the voice of the customer and will include acceptance criteria required to deliver that story. User stories usually follow a template: As a  type of user , I want  some goal  so that  some reason . A story is written for a small piece of work that can be completed independently from any of the other stories in the sprint backlog or product backlog. Each story has it's own 'card' that is represented on the sprint board.

Acceptance Criteria is additional information that provides the sprint team with more detail about how benefits will be delivered as part of this work being done and something for the product owner to check against when that story has been worked on and that work is ready to be reviewed. Stories are sometimes broken down further into tasks e.g. the steps required to complete the story.

Anyone on the sprint team can write the stories, they are generally reviewed and prioritised by the product owner. The user stories relate directly back to the epic's that the sprint team are delivering for.
