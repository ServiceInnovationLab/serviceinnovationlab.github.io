The following is content generated in the Transitioning to an Optimistic Future event held as part of Tech Week 2018. Duration 3 hours.

## Overview

The event was designed to build on the concepts and discussions had as part of the Digital Seven Nations and Optimistic Futures Event. In particular we wanted to focus on the human aspect of transition and what would be required of New Zealanders in the future. The topics of discussion were chosen as they we all universally understood human features and common daily activities. This created a level foundation to debate from as opposed to getting caught up in complex technologies and paradigms that could distract and exclude. The role of technology was tightly framed as an enabler and second to behaviour, attributes and activity.  

Event Description:

Building on the [Optimistic Futures](https://www.optimisticfutures.nz/) event held earlier in the year, in this workshop we will explore what's required for New Zealand/Aotearoa to transition to a better future, moving from an 18th century to a 21st century society.

This includes considering:

* the role of government
* the role of technology
* what foundations are needed to support society
* what role everyone would play in an optimistic future

Brought to you by [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/), [InternetNZ](https://internetnz.nz/) and the [Service Innovation Lab](http://serviceinnovationtoolkit.wikidot.com/main:about).

This event is part of the Techweek series on Building Government’s Digital Service Innovation Capability. The room was divided into 4 large groups for discussion and exploration.

## Group share and reflection

At the end of the day there was a group share and reflection which had the following insights.

* The initial discussion was not about the tech, it was about the people
* Of interest – dealing with someone’s intellect after death…and how this could benefit society
* Huge number of changes noticed with the activity – progressing from person’s exercise to societal benefits
* How will government incentivise the changes we’ve identified (that need to happen for optimistic future)?
** More intuitive change, tapping into the psyche of the people
* Noted we will share outputs from session plus what is happening at MBIE (digital strategy “speed dating” sessions)
* Starting off with the values was the right type of exercise J
** Had people think about what we’re trying to achieve/the end goal in mind
* Next conversations we need to have:
** Some kind of personal commitment – make it concrete
** Co-build a public facing repository of the information
* What caused most discussion:
** The ethical considerations + having a broader community discussion (beyond government)
** Where will the conversation take place + how do we bring other voices in?
 
## Activity One - Qualities to thrive as kiwis in 2070

Participants were asked to brainstorm qualities of an optimistic future in which kiwis could thrive and then chose 5 per group they felt were the most important.

Full Definitions of prioritised qualities: 

__Group 1 Def__

1. Empathy/sympathy/self awareness - understanding yourself, others and the impacts/consequences of your actions

    _Important because:_
    * We are seeing the dehumanisation of people in our current systems. Our optimistic future is truly human centred
    * Mātauranga Māori instead of economic outcomes, we measure social and environmental ones
    * We want a trust based society, not blockchain one
    * Rehumanise the workforce

2. Creativity - expression, problem solving, making an intuitive leap, to make an idea tangible. 

    _Important because:_
    * It will enable us to have a viable empowered future
    * Without creativity there is no progress
    * Forward momentum and flow
    * We can’t understand or express the art of the possible 
    * Learned helplessness and inability to envisage better systems 
    * Creativity makes people unique 

3. Curiosity and love of learning - desire to explore, understand the world around you

    _Important because:_
    * In a changing world, a love of learning will enable us to advance and embrace change with joy.

    * The world will only become more complex 
    * Love of Learning as a platform for your ability and confidence to respond to complexity 

4. Critical thinking - ability to discern truth, deconstruct content to value, truth and facts, ability to contextualise information - natural motivations, values etc

    _Important because:_
    * Deception will become grander and more complex (especially technological ability to fabricate falsehood)
    * Value truth over a good story

5. Maker Skills - the skills and perspective that assumes you can form the world around you, you are not bound by the tools you have, you build what you need and are empowered to do so

    _Important because:_
    * We have the tech to create anything - enables us to build bespoke solutions for what we need
    * Don’t have to be passive consumers
    * Empowered to be critical creative and make things

3. Empathy - do things with people not to people, understanding without appropriation, try to feel what other people feel, empathetic > Sympathetic (empowering > Patronising)
4. Curiosity - opportunity to learn, improve, contribute, at the top of the hierarchy of needs, in the boundaries of what’s acceptable, ethics, different power structures, may be self-disruptive, it’s good but can be dangerous.
5. Reflection - share failures, transparency, look in the mirror, meditative, requires space and time, truth - don’t erase the facts, fits with work/life balance, understanding our past and learning from it, take pause and reflect integrate inputs

## Activity Two - Performing actions today vs 2070

Participants were asked to choose one of the following activities and explore the process both today and in 2070 and how their qualities from Activity One might impact how they are performed. 

__Activities:__

* Start a business

__2070:__

* less unexpected deaths, so person has time to manage affairs, more euthanasia, plenned funerals
* bio tracking knows you've died, user-authorised services are notified and person's wishes enacted - still human gatekeeper 
* funeral - laws prohibiting satellite corpses, energy considered in body removal, homogenised religious/cultural approach?
* relationship to physical body changes as consciousness is able to be uploaded
* therapy for mourning
* An AI likeness lives on
* The life long learning of the person lives on in IP commons. Can someone else download a consciousness or ideas/knowledge from that person?

### Grow food - nutrition - Group 2

__Now:__

* Plan (space, season, crops, compliance)
* Prepare (dig, single vs family vs commercial consumption, water requirements, pest control, fencing, composting/supplements)
* Plants, maintain, harvest and back to planning with some automation employed for larger operations.

__2070:__

* Vertical, shared and more diversity in crops and methods
* Disruption to supply chain
* Tracability of crop lineage and social responsibility
* Better ways to measure the value of growing food

* Know your market and integrate with environmental factors
* Supermarkets dominate

__2070 (with qualities):__

* NZ developes best protein DNA
* DNA of cow - headless carcass with no pain (ethics)
* grow at home - 3D printing, predictive & inspiring, based on individual needs, land gets back to early state and rich biodiversity
* open sourcing of food production - sharing DNA code, incentivised social schemes & govt policy with different motives and measurements from today
* All supported by: decisive, courageous, resilient, sustainable, and kind/inclusive values.

## Activity Three - Roles & Requirements

__Participants were asked to then reflect on the previous activities and discuss and answer the following questions:__
