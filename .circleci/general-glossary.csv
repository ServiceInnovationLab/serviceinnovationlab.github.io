"Agile 
(Kakama)","Agile is a method of project management, used especially for software development (but is now being used more widely than just development), that is characterised by the division of tasks into short phases of work and frequent reassessment and adaptation of plans.","Agile was originally an approach for software development (but is now being adopted more widely in different industries). The agile method gives teams the ability to take requirements and allows for their solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organising and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. It focuses the team on 'just enough' (or minimal viable product) and those pieces of work should be able to be completed within a one to two week planning cycle.

With the focus not being purely on software development the original Manifesto for Agile Software Development has evolved to Modern Agile (see links following), which makes agile as a method accessible to other industries.The values and principles have been derived from and underpin a broad range of frameworks, including Scrum and Kanban.",,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development

API,Application Programming Interface,"A set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. Computer programs are typically organised and assembled into some type of software components that are combined to form larger IT systems.  To prevent a massive tangle of complex software in which every piece of software is able to talk to every other piece of software, interfaces (or APIs) are used to partition the IT system.  

An API hides a lot of detail of the internal workings of a software component that the outside world does not need to know.  In this way, APIs provide a description of how to use the functionality of a software component and to exchange data with it.  At run-time, software components interact with one another through the application programming interface.

Governments are currently thinking about APIs for service delivery, including how open government APIs can be used to deliver innovative services by third parties, and by businesses to directly transact with government.","""There are over a thousand applications which use the Trade Me API, built by individuals or organisations outside Trade Me. These applications provide services which meet needs of users not catered for by the Trade Me website or API - in some cases by providing a different interface to the same underlying functions - and in other cases by mashing up a combination of APIs.""

Encryption,"Converting data from a readable form to an encoded version that can only be decoded by another party if they have access to a decryption key. Encryption is used to help keep data private, both when it is  transmitted across networks, and when it is stored.","There are two common categories of encryption:

1) Aymmetric-key ciphers, also referred to as ""secret key,"" use a single key, sometimes referred to as a shared secret because the system doing the encryption must share it with any entity it intends to be able to decrypt the encrypted data. The most widely used symmetric-key cipher is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which was designed to protect government classified information. The challenge with this form of encryption is that the sender must exchange the key used to encrypt the data with the recipient before the recipient can perform decryption on the ciphertext. The need to securely distribute and manage large numbers of keys means most cryptographic processes use a symmetric algorithm to efficiently encrypt data, but they use an asymmetric algorithm to securely exchange the secret key.

2) Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses two different but mathematically linked keys, one public and one private. The public key can be shared with everyone (and is used to encrypt data), whereas the private key must be kept secret (as it is used to decrypt data which has been encrypted with the private key). The RSA encryption algorithm is the most widely used public key algorithm (the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) used by web browsers using the HTTPS protocol). 
This form of cryptography can also be used to ensure the integrity (was the data altered since being encrypted), authenticity (are you sure it came from the source you think it did) of data through the use of digital signatures.","Emerging Tech Landscape:

Hypothesis,"A provisional idea which is proven to be ""true"" or ""false"" through an experiment. ","If you believe something might be true but don’t yet have definitive proof, it is considered a theory (or hypothesis) until that proof is provided

For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can verify or test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. 

In ""entrepreneurial science"", a hypothesis is used to formulate provisional ideas within a business setting. The formulated hypothesis is then evaluated where either the hypothesis is proven to be ""true"" or ""false"" through an experiment which is either verifiability or falsifiability oriented .",,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis

For a very formal definition of hypothesis testing:

Hypothesis - Null Hypothesis,A null hypothesis is the proposition that there is no cause and effect relationship between phenomena or populations. ,"Using a null hypothesis is useful because it can be tested and found to be false, which then implies that there is a relationship between the observed data.

It is much easier to disprove a hypothesis than to positively prove one.

A common approach is to reject a null hypothesis if the observed data are significantly unlikely (stats definition) to have occurred if the null hypothesis were true.","""Hyperactivity is unrelated to eating sugar"" is an example of a null hypothesis. If the hypothesis is tested and found to be false, using statistics, then a connection between hyperactivity and sugar ingestion may be indicated. A significance test is the most common statistical test used to establish confidence in a null hypothesis.""

""You may be wondering why you would want to test a hypothesis just to find it false. Why not just test an alternate hypothesis and find it true? The short answer is that it is part of the scientific method. In science, propositions are not explicitly ""proven."" Rather, science uses math to determine the probability that a statement is true or false. It turns out it's much easier to disprove a hypothesis than to positively prove one. Also, while the null hypothesis may be simply stated, there's a good chance the alternate hypothesis is incorrect.""","Wikipedia

Design Insights can shape a project during any point in the product development process by revealing behavior patterns that are normally lost, hidden or obscured. By bringing these patterns in view, we can make observations and form connections between them, as well as predict future behaviors.

It has enormous potential to help us measure, understand, and improve how we work and live.

1) A number of factors mean that the number of connected things is skyrocketing (Gartner estimatres by 2020 there will be over 26 billion connected devices, some say 100 billion). Big contibutors include the cost of connecting to the internet decreasing rapidly, and more and more devices being created with Wi-Fi capabilities (and sensors built in) - again due to costs coming down.
2) The ""internet"" in the name is misleading because devices may be connected in a home or factory via non-IP (internet) networks (such as ""ZigBee"") to a router. The impact of these connected devices is typically included when talking about IoT.

They are generally written in the voice of the customer and will include acceptance criteria required to deliver that story. User stories usually follow a template: As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >. A story is written for a small piece of work that can be completed independently from any of the other stories in the <sprint backlog> or <product backlog>. Each story has it's own 'card' that is represented on the <sprint board>.

Acceptance Criteria is additional information that provides the <sprint team> with more detail about how benefits will be delivered as part of this work being done and something for the <product owner> to check against when that story has been worked on and that work is ready to be reviewed. Stories are sometimes broken down further into tasks e.g. the steps required to complete the story.

Anyone on the <sprint team> can write the stories, they are generally reviewed and prioritised by the <product owner>. The user stories relate directly back to the <epic>'s that the <sprint team> are delivering for.
