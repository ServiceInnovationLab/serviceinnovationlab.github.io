# The website of the Service Innovation Lab.

This website currently aims at storing long-term articles and reports. The official blog of the team still lives at [digital.govt.nz/blog](https://www.digital.govt.nz/blog/).

This website can be publicly accessed at [serviceinnovationlab.github.io](https://serviceinnovationlab.github.io).

## Building

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

Please refer to its [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) to install the gem and build the website locally if you want to test your changes before sharing them.


## Hosting

This website is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).


## Deploying

The `master` branch of the [serviceinnovationlab.github.io](https://github.com/serviceinnovationlab/serviceinnovationlab.github.io) is always deployed at `serviceinnovationlab.github.io`.

This is the reason why all changes should be reviewed before being merged into `master`: merging is sharing with the world!
